Abstract
"We review in the present article the conjecture of electromagnetic mass by
Lorentz. The philosophical perspectives and historical accounts of this idea
are described, especially, in the light of Einstein's special relativistic
formula {E = mc^2}. It is shown that the Lorentz's electromagnetic mass model
has taken various shapes through its journey and the goal is not yet reached."
"We present a high S/N spectrum for the quasar PG 1138+222. We detect a very
broad HeII$\lambda$4686 emission line component with twice the FWHM of the
conventional broad line region (BLR) as evidenced by the Balmer lines. The
profile shape and centroid redshift also distinguish this HeII component from
the BLR features. The large ratio of HeII\l 4686 to any analogous H$\beta$
emission component is an indicator that it arises in a very high density region
($n_e \simgt 10^{11}-10^{13}$ \cm3). This Helium component is probably emitted
in a Very Broad Line Region (VBLR), where the radiation field is so strong that
the Str\""omgren depth becomes similar to the geometrical thickness of the
emitting clouds. The gas could therefore be optically thin to the Lyman
continuum."
"It is argued on the basis of certain mathematical characteristics that
classical mechanics is not constitutionally suited to accomodate consciousness,
whereas quantum mechanics is. These mathematical characteristics pertain to the
nature of the information represented in the state of the brain, and the way
this information enters into the dynamics."
"The LMC-complexity introduced by Lopez-Ruiz, Mancini and Calbet [Phys. Lett.
A 209, 321-326 (1995)] is calculated for different physical situations: one
instance of classical statistical mechanics, normal and exponential
distributions, and a simplified laser model. We stand out the specific value of
the population inversion for which the laser presents maximun complexity."
"We investigate observational constraints on dark energy models from lookback
time (LT) estimates of 32 old passive galaxies distributed over the redshift
interval $0.11 \leq z \leq 1.84$. To build up our LT sample we combine the age
measurements for these 32 objects with estimates of the total age of the
Universe, as obtained from current CMB data. We show that LT data may provide
bounds on the cosmological parameters with accuracy competitive with type Ia
Supernova methods. In order to break possible degeneracies between models
parameters, we also discuss the bounds when our lookback time versus redshift
sample is combined with with the recent measurement of the baryonic acoustic
oscillation peak and the derived age of the Universe from current CMB
measurements."
"We present observational results of the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission from the
jets of L1551 IRS 5. The data sets were obtained through 13 fully sampled slits
aimed at the base of the jets. These sets are used to construct a
three-dimensional cube. The field of view was 5.""8 X 4.""2. We confirmed that
the position of the knot PHK1 coincides with a stationary, point-like x-ray
source within 0.""3. The northern and southern jets are distinguished from each
other at a point 0.""6 away from their driving sources. We also confirmed that
the northern jet consists of well-separated high- and low-velocity components
(HVC and LVC, respectively). The HVC has a terminal velocity of ~400 km/s and
shows a consistently narrow velocity width of 40 km/s. The LVC covers the
velocity range from V_LSR = 0 to -240 km/s and has broad velocity widths of
~150-180 km/s. These decrease with distance from the driving sources. The
spatial width of the LVC varies from 0.""6-0.""7 at V_LSR ~ -200 km/s to
0.""8-0.""9 at V_LSR ~ -30 km/s. These characteristics are well understood in
terms of the two types of outflow mechanisms that are working simultaneously:
one is the HVC, which is launched in a narrow, inner radial region at 0.04-0.05
AU, and the other is the LVC, which is launched in a wider, outer radial region
from within 0.1-4.5 AU of the accretion disk. Part of the LVC emission could
arise in the gas entrained or shocked by the HVC. We also discuss the
possibility that part of the HVC gas is thermalized at PHK1 to produce the
x-ray emission and LVC."
"An analysis of single-electron orbits in combined coaxial wiggler and axial
guide magnetic fields is presented. Solutions of the equations of motion are
developed in a form convenient for computing orbital velocity components and
trajectories in the radially dependent wiggler. Simple analytical solutions are
obtained in the radially-uniform-wiggler approximation and a formula for the
derivative of the axial velocity $v_{\|}$ with respect to Lorentz factor
$\gamma$ is derived. Results of numerical computations are presented and the
characteristics of the equilibrium orbits are discussed. The third spatial
harmonic of the coaxial wiggler field gives rise to group $III$ orbits which
are characterized by a strong negative mass regime."
"It is becoming widely recognized that, contrary to earlier expectations, the
usual one-band Hubbard model does not give an explanation for itinerant
ferromagnetism. After reviewing the status of magnetic ordering in the one-band
model, we discuss the possibility of ferromagnetism in some recently introduced
two-band Hubbard models, and in generalized Anderson lattices. It is argued
that these two classes of models are closely related and that it is their
common feature that the ferromagnetic phase has to compete with a collective
Kondo state."
"An analytical-numeric calculation method of extremely complicated integrals
is presented. These integrals appear often in magnet soliton theory. The
appropriate analytical continuation and a corresponding integration contour
allow to reduce the calculation of wide class of integrals to a numeric search
of integrand denominator roots (in a complex plane) and a subsequent residue
calculations. The acceleration of series convergence of residue sum allows to
reach the high relative accuracy limited only by roundoff error in case when
$10\div 15$ terms are taken into account. The circumscribed algorithm is
realized in the C program and tested on the example allowing analytical
solution. The program was also used to calculate some typical integrals that
can not be expressed through elementary functions. In this case the control of
calculation accuracy was made by means of one-dimensional numerical integration
procedure."
"We propose here a new model of encryption of binary data taking advantage of
the complexity associated with delayed dynamics. In this scheme, the encryption
process is a coupling dynamics with various time delays between different bits
in the original data. It is shown that decoding of the encrypted data is
extremely difficult without a complete knowledge of coupling manner with
associated delays for all bits of the data."
"The asymptotic frequency $\omega$, dependence of the dynamic viscosity of
neutral hard sphere colloidal suspensions is shown to be of the form $\eta_0
A(\phi) (\omega \tau_P)^{-1/2}$, where $A(\phi)$ has been determined as a
function of the volume fraction $\phi$, for all concentrations in the fluid
range, $\eta_0$ is the solvent viscosity and $\tau_P$ the P\'{e}clet time. For
a soft potential it is shown that, to leading order steepness, the asymptotic
behavior is the same as that for the hard sphere potential and a condition for
the cross-over behavior to $1/\omega \tau_P$ is given. Our result for the hard
sphere potential generalizes a result of Cichocki and Felderhof obtained at low
concentrations and agrees well with the experiments of van der Werff et al, if
the usual Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficient $D_0$ in the Smoluchowski
operator is consistently replaced by the short-time self diffusion coefficient
$D_s(\phi)$ for non-dilute colloidal suspensions."
"Statistical mechanics provides a useful analog for understanding the behavior
of complex adaptive systems, including power markets and the power systems they
intend to govern. Transaction-based control is founded on the conjecture that
the regulation of complex systems based on price-mediated strategies (e.g.,
auctions, markets) results in an optimal allocation of resources and an
emergent optimal control. We outline a model based on strict analogies to
thermodynamic quantities. The model accurately describes power market data
collected from three North American independent system operators (ISO) in
recent years. The ISO data is analyzed, comparing the behavioral similarities
and differences that are observed."
"We present the results from e+e- coincidence measurements in 238U + 206Pb
collisions at a beam energy of 5.93 MeV/u, using an improved experimental setup
at the double-Orange spectrometer of GSI. The capability of our device to
detect Internal-Pair-Conversion (IPC) e+e- pairs from discrete nuclear
transitions of a moving emitter is demonstrated by investigating the known
1.844 MeV (E1) transition in 206Pb and the 1.770 MeV (M1) transition in 207Pb,
excited via Coulomb excitation and a neutron transfer reaction, respectively.
The Doppler-shift corrected e+- sum-energy spectra show weak lines at the
expected energies with cross sections being consistent with the measured
excitation cross sections of the corresponding $\gamma$ lines and the
theoretically predicted IPC coefficients. No other e+e- sum-energy lines were
found in the measured spectra. The observed transfer cross sections show a
strong dependence on the distance of closest approach (R_min), thus signaling
also a strong dependence on the bombarding energy close to the Coulomb barrier."
"Perfusion analysis computes blood flow parameters (blood volume, blood flow,
mean transit time) from the observed flow of contrast agent, passing through
the patient's vascular system. Perfusion deconvolution has been widely accepted
as the principal numerical tool for perfusion analysis, and is used routinely
in clinical applications. This extensive use of perfusion in clinical
decision-making makes numerical stability and robustness of perfusion
computations vital for accurate diagnostics and patient safety. The main goal
of this paper is to propose a novel approach for validating numerical
properties of perfusion algorithms. The approach is based on Perfusion
Linearity Property (PLP), which we find in perfusion deconvolution, as well as
in many other perfusion techniques. PLP allows one to study perfusion values as
weighted averages of the original imaging data. This, in turn, uncovers hidden
problems with the existing deconvolution techniques, and may be used to suggest
more reliable computational approaches and methodology."
"We consider fermion-gauge couplings in the Wilson-Yukawa approach for lattice
chiral gauge theories. At the leading order of a fermionic hopping parameter
expansion we find that the fermion-gauge coupling has a chiral and tree-like
structure. We argue that this fermion-gauge coupling remains non-zero in the
continuum limit taken in the Higgs phase. Possible fermion-scalar couplings in
this approach are considered. We also evaluate the fermion interaction with an
external gauge field in the slightly modified model and show that it has a
chiral structure in general."
"Here, we present numerical simulations of magnetic flux buoyantly rising from
a granular convection zone into the low corona. We study the complex
interaction of the magnetic field with the turbulent plasma. The model includes
the radiative loss terms, non-ideal equations of state, and empirical corona
heating. We find that the convection plays a crucial role in shaping the
morphology and evolution of the emerging structure. The emergence of magnetic
fields can disrupt the convection pattern as the field strength increases, and
form an ephemeral region-like structure, while weak magnetic flux emerges and
quickly becomes concentrated in the intergranular lanes, i.e. downflow regions.
As the flux rises, a coherent shear pattern in the low corona is observed in
the simulation. In the photosphere, both magnetic shearing and velocity
shearing occur at a very sharp polarity inversion line (PIL). In a case of
U-loop magnetic field structure, the field above the surface is highly sheared
while below it is relaxed."
"A logical explanation as to why the choice of the Pian-Sumihara basis (as a
linear basis to approximate stress) leads to greater efficiency in enhanced
strain problems, is presented. An Airy stress function and the consequent
selective simplification resulting from the differentiation of an implied,
single, parent approximating polynomial, are the essence of this argument."
"Using mean-field theory, we study the equilibrium properties of boson-fermion
mixtures confined in a harmonic pancake-shaped trap at zero temperature. When
the modulus of the s-wave scattering lengths are comparable to the mixture
thickness, two-dimensional scattering events introduce a logarithmic dependence
on density in the coupling constants, greatly modifying the density profiles
themselves. We show that for the case of a negative boson-fermion
three-dimensional s-wave scattering length, the dimensional crossover
stabilizes the mixture against collapse and drives it towards spatial demixing."
"Lyapunov exponents can be difficult to determine from experimental data. In
particular, when using embedding theory to build chaotic attractors in a
reconstruction space, extra ""spurious"" Lyapunov exponents arise that are not
Lyapunov exponents of the original system. By studying the local linearization
matrices that are key to the Eckmann-Ruelle method for computing Lyapunov
exponents, we determine explicit formulas for the spurious exponents in certain
cases. Notably, when a two-dimensional system with Lyapunov exponents A and B
is reconstructed in a five-dimensional space, we show that the reconstructed
system has exponents A, B, 2A, A+B, 2B."
"We consider a standard \textit{susceptible-infected-susceptible} (SIS) model
to study behaviors of steady states of epidemic spreading in small-world
networks. Using analytical methods and large scale simulations, we recover the
usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold $\lambda_{c}$ below which
infectious diseases die out. Whereas for the spreading rate $\lambda$ far above
$\lambda_{c}$, it was found that the density of infected individuals $\rho$ as
a function of $\lambda$ has the property $\rho \approx F(K)(\ln \lambda - \ln
\lambda_{c})$."
"We present the first experimental observation of modulation instability of
partially spatially incoherent light beams in non-instantaneous nonlinear
media. We show that even in such a nonlinear partially coherent system (of
weakly-correlated particles) patterns can form spontaneously. Incoherent MI
occurs above a specific threshold that depends on the beams' coherence
properties (correlation distance), and leads to a periodic train of
one-dimensional (1D) filaments. At a higher value of nonlinearity, incoherent
MI displays a two-dimensional (2D) instability and leads to self-ordered arrays
of light spots."
"Based on a three-potential formalism we propose mathematically well-behaved
Faddeev-type integral equations for the atomic three-body problem and descibe
their solutions in Coulomb-Sturmian space representation. Although the system
contains only long-range Coulomb interactions these equations allow us to reach
solution by approximating only some auxiliary short-range type potentials. We
outline the method for bound states and demonstrate its power in benchmark
calculations. We can report a fast convergence in angular momentum channels."
"In this paper, a new method to efficiently simulate diffusion controlled
second order chemical reactions is derived and applied to site-specific
DNA-binding proteins. The protein enters a spherical cell and propagates via
two competing modes, a free diffusion and a DNA-sliding mode, to search for its
specific binding site in the center of the cell. There is no need for a
straightforward simulation of this process. Instead, an alternative and exact
approach is shown to be essentially faster than explicit random-walk
simulations. The speed-up of this novel simulation technique is rapidly growing
with system size."
"We do several simple calculations and measurements in an effort to gain
understanding of global warming and the carbon cycle. Some conclusions are
interesting: (i) There has been global warming since the end of the ""little ice
age"" around 1700. There is no statistically significant evidence of
acceleration of global warming since 1940. (ii) The increase of CO_2 in the
atmosphere, beginning around 1940, accurately tracks the burning of fossil
fuels. Burning all of the remaining economically viable reserves of oil, gas
and coal over the next 150 years or so will approximately double the
pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of CO_2. The corresponding increase in
the average temperature, due to the greenhouse effect, is quite uncertain:
between 1.3 and 4.8K. This increase of temperature is (partially?) offset by
the increase of aerosols and deforestation. (iii) Ice core samples indicate
that the pre-historic CO_2 concentration and temperature are well correlated.
We conclude that changes in the temperatures of the oceans are probably the
cause of the changes of pre-historic atmospheric CO_2 concentration. (iv) Data
suggests that large volcanic explosions can trigger transitions from glacial to
interglacial climates. (v) Most of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis in the
Amazon basin returns to the atmosphere due to aerobic decay."
"Most of the devices in the SLAC control system are accessed via interface
modules in ~450 CAMAC crates. Low-cost controllers in these crates communicate
via a SLAC-proprietary bit-serial protocol with 77 satellite control computers
(""micros"") within the accelerator complex. A proposed upgrade replaces the
existing Multibus-I implementation of the micro hardware with
commercial-off-the-shelf (""COTS"") personal computers. For increased reliability
and ease of maintenance, these micros will move from their current electrically
noisy and environmentally challenging sites to the control center's computer
room, with only a stand-alone portion of each micro's CAMAC interface remaining
in the micro's original location. This paper describes the hardware/software
architecture of that intelligent front-end CAMAC controller and the
accompanying fiber optic link board that connects it to the PC-based micro's
PCI bus. Emphasis is placed on the hardware/software techniques employed to
minimize real-time latency for pulse-to-pulse operations that control
accelerator timing, acquire data for fast feedback loops, and change device
settings to close those loops. The controller provides the sole interface
between the COTS computing/networking environment and the existing CAMAC plant.
It also supports higher bandwidth commercial byte-serial crate controllers and
legacy BITBUS hardware."
"In this work, a scalable and modular architecture for massive MIMO base
stations with distributed processing is proposed. New antennas can readily be
added by adding a new node as each node handles all the additional involved
processing. The architecture supports conjugate beamforming, zero-forcing, and
MMSE, where for the two latter cases a central matrix inversion is required.
The impact of the time required for this matrix inversion is carefully analyzed
along with a generic frame format. As part of the contribution, careful
computational, memory, and communication analyses are presented. It is shown
that all computations can be mapped to a single computational structure and
that a processing node consisting of a single such processing element can
handle a broad range of bandwidths and number of terminals."
"MUSE, a 2nd generation VLT instrument, will become the world's largest
integral field spectrograph. It will be an AO assisted instrument which, in a
single exposure, covers the wavelength range from 465 to 930 nm with an average
resolution of 3000 over a field of view of 1'x1' with 0.2'' spatial sampling.
Both the complexity and the rate of the data are a challenge for the data
processing of this instrument.
  We will give an overview of the data processing scheme that has been designed
for MUSE. Specifically, we will use only a single resampling step from the raw
data to the reduced data product. This allows us to improve data quality,
accurately propagate variance, and minimize spreading of artifacts and
correlated noise. This approach necessitates changes to the standard way in
which reduction steps like wavelength calibration and sky subtraction are
carried out, but can be expanded to include combination of multiple exposures."
"We consider the Harper model which describes two dimensional Bloch electrons
in a magnetic field. For irrational flux through the unit-cell the
corresponding energy spectrum is known to be a Cantor set with multifractal
properties. In order to relate the maximal and minimal fractal dimension of the
spectrum of Harper's equation to the irrational number involved, we combine a
refined version of the Hofstadter rules with results from semiclassical
analysis and tunneling in phase space. For quadratic irrationals $\omega$ with
continued fraction expansion $\omega = [0;\overline{n}]$ the maximal fractal
dimension exhibits oscillatory behavior as a function of $n$, which can be
explained by the structure of the renormalization flow. The asymptotic behavior
of the minimal fractal dimension is given by $\amin \sim {\rm const.} \ln n /
n$. As the generalized dimensions can be related to the anomalous diffusion
exponents of an initially localized wavepacket, our results imply that the time
evolution of high order moments $< r^{q} >, q \to \infty$ is sensible to the
parity of $n$."
"The current generation of Imaging Atmospheric telescopes (IACTs) has
demonstrated the power of this observational technique, providing high
sensitivity and an angular resolution of $\sim0.1^{\circ}$ per event above an
energy threshold of $\sim$100 GeV. Planned future arrays of IACTs such as AGIS
or CTA are aiming at significantly improving the angular resolution.
Preliminary results have shown that values down to $\sim 1'$ might be
achievable. Here we present results of Monte-Carlo simulations that aim to
exploring the limits of angular resolution for next generation IACTs and
investigate how the resolution can be optimised by changes to array and
telescope parameters such as the number of pixel in the camera, the field of
view of the camera, the angular pixel size, the mirror size, and also the
telescope separation."
"We propose a bilinear sampling algorithm in Green's function Monte Carlo for
expectation values of operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian and
for differences between eigenvalues of different Hamiltonians. The integral
representations of the Schroedinger equations are transformed into two
equations whose solution has the form $\psi_a(x) t(x,y) \psi_b(y)$, where
$\psi_a$ and $\psi_b$ are the wavefunctions for the two related systems and
$t(x,y)$ is a kernel chosen to couple $x$ and $y$. The Monte Carlo process,
with random walkers on the enlarged configuration space $x \otimes y$, solves
these equations by generating densities whose asymptotic form is the above
bilinear distribution. With such a distribution, exact Monte Carlo estimators
can be obtained for the expectation values of quantum operators and for energy
differences. We present results of these methods applied to several test
problems, including a model integral equation, and the hydrogen atom."
"Within the class of stochastic cellular automata models of traffic flows, we
look at the velocity dependent randomization variant (VDR-TCA) whose parameters
take on a specific set of extreme values. These initial conditions lead us to
the discovery of the emergence of four distinct phases. Studying the
transitions between these phases, allows us to establish a rigorous
classification based on their tempo-spatial behavioral characteristics. As a
result from the system's complex dynamics, its flow-density relation exhibits a
non-concave region in which forward propagating density waves are encountered.
All four phases furthermore share the common property that moving vehicles can
never increase their speed once the system has settled into an equilibrium."
"We demonstrate for the first time that gaseous halos of disk galaxies can
play a vital role in recycling metal-rich gas ejected from the bulges and thus
in promoting chemical evolution of disks. Our numerical simulations show that
metal-rich stellar winds from bulges in disk galaxies can be accreted onto the
thin disks owing to hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous ejecta and
the gaseous halos, if the mean densities of the halos (rho_ hg) are as high as
10^{-5} cm^{-3}. The total amount of gas that is ejected from a bulge through a
stellar wind and then accreted onto the disk depends mainly on rho_ hg and the
initial velocity of the stellar wind. About ~ 1% of gaseous ejecta from bulges
in disk galaxies of scale length a_d can be accreted onto disks around R ~ 2.5
a_ d for a reasonable set of model parameters. We discuss these results in the
context of the origin of the surprisingly high metallicities of the solar
neighborhood disk stars in the Galaxy. We also discuss some implications of the
present results in terms of chemical evolution of disk galaxies with possibly
different rho_ hg in different galaxy environments."
"Lens aberrations have previously been used to determine the provenance of an
image. However, this is not necessarily unique to an image sensor, as lens
systems are often interchanged. Photo-response non-uniformity noise was
proposed in 2005 by Luk\'a\v{s}, Goljan and Fridrich as a stochastic signal
which describes a sensor uniquely, akin to a ""ballistic"" fingerprint. This
method, however, did not account for additional sources of bias such as lens
artefacts and temperature.
  In this paper, we propose a new additive signal model to account for
artefacts previously thought to have been isolated from the ballistic
fingerprint. Our proposed model separates sensor level artefacts from the lens
optical system and thus accounts for lens aberrations previously thought to be
filtered out. Specifically, we apply standard image processing theory, an
understanding of frequency properties relating to the physics of light and
temperature response of sensor dark current to classify artefacts. This model
enables us to isolate and account for bias from the lens optical system and
temperature within the current model."
"Heat capacity curves as functions of temperature were calculated using Monte
Carlo methods for the series of Ne_(13-n)Ar_n clusters (0 <= n <= 13). The
clusters were modeled classically using pairwise additive Lennard-Jones
potentials. The J-walking (or jump-walking) method was used to overcome
systematic errors due to quasiergodicity. Substantial discrepancies between the
J-walking results and those obtained using standard Metropolis methods were
found. Results obtained using the atom-exchange method, another Monte Carlo
variant for multi-component systems, also did not compare well with the
J-walker results. Quench studies were done to investigate the clusters'
potential energy surfaces. Only those Ne-Ar clusters consisting predominately
of either one or the other component had lowest energy isomers having the
icosahedral-like symmetry typical of homogeneous 13-atom rare gas clusters;
non-icosahedral structures dominated the lowest-energy isomers for the other
clusters. This resulted in heat capacity curves that were very much different
than that of their homogeneous counterpart. Evidence for coexistence behavior
different than that seen in homogenous clusters is also presented."
"Next-generation high-speed passive optical network (HS-PON) transceivers
supporting 25, 50 and 100 Gb/s are under the early stage of their
standardization process. One key aspect of this process is the choice of the
best modulation format. To this end, performance comparisons among several
modulation formats against different physical constraints have been presented
in literature and are still being carried out. In our contribution, we
performed an exhaustive analysis on the impact of transceivers electrical
frequency response shape on the performance of 2-levels pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM-2), 4-levels PAM (PAM-4), electrical and optical duobinary
modulation formats with adaptive equalizer at the receiver side. We show by
means of numerical simulations that the specification of the typically used
-3dB bandwidth is not sufficient, since also out-of-band electrical frequency
response specifications (such as the -20dB bandwidth) has a huge impact on the
performance of the analyzed modulation formats. The normalized graphs given at
the end of the paper in terms of -3dB and -20 dB bandwidths can thus be useful
for the design of the next generation of HS-PON transceivers."
"Scanning tunneling microscopy can provide a probe for the detailed study of
quasiparticle states in high-Tc superconductors. We propose that it can also be
used to acquire specific information about impurity-induced quasiparticle
states and the superconducting order-parameter structure. In particular, the
local density of states is found to be sensitive to impurity-induced resonances
and to the symmetry of the order parameter."
"The ability to localize, identify and measure the electronic environment of
individual atoms will provide fundamental insights into many issues in
materials science, physics and nanotechnology. We demonstrate, using an
aberration-corrected scanning transmission microscope, the spectroscopic
imaging of single La atoms inside CaTiO3. Dynamical simulations confirm that
the spectroscopic information is spatially confined around the scattering atom.
Furthermore we show how the depth of the atom within the crystal may be
estimated."
"With tangent angle perturbation approach the axial symmetry deformation of a
spherical vesicle in large under the pressure changes is studied by the
elasticity theory of Helfrich spontaneous curvature model.Three main results in
axial symmetry shape: biconcave shape, peanut shape, and one type of myelin are
obtained. These axial symmetry morphology deformations are in agreement with
those observed in lipsome experiments by dark-field light microscopy [Hotani,
J. Mol. Biol. 178, (1984) 113] and in the red blood cell with two thin
filaments (myelin) observed in living state (see, Bessis, Living Blood Cells
and Their Ultrastructure, Springer-Verlag, 1973). Furthermore, the biconcave
shape and peanut shape can be simulated with the help of a powerful software,
Surface Evolver [Brakke, Exp. Math. 1, 141 (1992) 141], in which the
spontaneous curvature can be easy taken into account."
"The set of solutions to the string equation $[P,Q]=1$ where $P$ and $Q$ are
differential operators is described.It is shown that there exists one-to-one
correspondence between this set and the set of pairs of commuting differential
operators.This fact permits us to describe the set of solutions to the string
equation in terms of moduli spa- ces of algebraic curves,however the direct
description is much simpler. Some results are obtained for the superanalog to
the string equation where $P$ and $Q$ are considered as superdifferential
operators. It is proved that this equation is invariant with respect to
Manin-Radul, Mulase-Rabin and Kac-van de Leur KP-hierarchies."
"We study the distributions of dropped calls rates for different wireless
(cellular) carriers in different markets. Our statistics comprises over 700
different market/carrier combinations. We find that the dropped calls rates
distribution is very close to lognormal. We derive an equation for the most
probable dropped calls rate for particular carrier in particular market, which
depends on the number of dropped calls observed, total number of calls and the
parameters of the lognormal distribution. We apply this analysis to blocked and
""no service"" calls as well."
"Blue hook (BHk) stars are a rare class of horizontal branch stars that so far
have been found in only very few Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The dominant
mechanism for producing these objects is currently still unclear. In order to
test if the presence of BHk populations in a given GC is linked to specific
physical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sample
of GCs for which existing data is sufficient to establish the presence or
absence of BHk populations with confidence. We then compare the properties of
those clusters in our parent sample that do contain a BHk population to those
that do not. We find that there is only one compelling difference between BHk
and non-BHk clusters: all known BHk clusters are unusually massive. However, we
also find that the BHk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributed
within the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. Thus, while it is
attractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable of
forming BHk stars, the data do not require this. Instead, the apparent
preference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect:
intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently large
number of stars."
"Progressing methods of drawings creating automation is discussed on the basis
of so-called modules containing parametric representation of a part of the
drawing and the geometrical elements. The stages of evolution of modular
technology of automation of engineering are describing alternatives of applying
of moduluss for simple association of elements of the drawing without
parametric representation with an opportunity of its commenting, for graphic
symbols creating in the schemas of automation and drawings of pipelines, for
storage of the specific properties of elements, for development of the
specialized parts of the project: the axonometric schemas, profiles of outboard
pipe networks etc."
"We review several procedures of quantization formulated in the framework of
(classical) phase space M. These quantization methods consider Quantum
Mechanics as a ""deformation"" of Classical Mechanics by means of the
""transformation"" of the commutative algebra of smooth functions on M in a new
non-commutative algebra. These ideas lead in a natural way to Quantum Groups as
deformation (or quantization, in a broad sense) of Poisson-Lie groups, which is
also analysed here."
"Recent research has shown that distinct physical regions in the Venusian
induced magnetosphere are recognizable from the variations of strength of the
magnetic field and its wave/fluctuation activity. In this paper the statistical
properties of magnetic fluctuations are investigated in the Venusian
magnetosheath and wake regions. The main goal is to identify the characteristic
scaling features of fluctuations along Venus Express (VEX) trajectory and to
understand the specific circumstances of the occurrence of different types of
scalings. For the latter task we also use the results of measurements from the
previous missions to Venus. Our main result is that the changing character of
physical interactions between the solar wind and the planetary obstacle is
leading to different types of spectral scaling in the near-Venusian space.
Noisy fluctuations are observed in the magnetosheath, wavy structures near the
terminator and in the nightside near-planet wake. Multi-scale turbulence is
observed at the magnetosheath boundary layer and near the quasi-parallel bow
shock. Magnetosheath boundary layer turbulence is associated with an average
magnetic field which is nearly aligned with the Sun-Venus line. Noisy magnetic
fluctuations are well described with the Gaussian statistics. Both
magnetosheath boundary layer and near shock turbulence statistics exhibit
non-Gaussian features and intermittency over small spatio-temporal scales. The
occurrence of turbulence near magnetosheath boundaries can be responsible for
the local heating of plasma observed by previous missions."
"We construct a generalized multiplicative renormalization group
transformation to study the low energy dynamics of a heavy particle tunneling
among $M$ different positions and interacting with $N_f$ independent conduction
electron channels. Using a $1/N_f$-expansion we show that this M-level scales
towards a fixed point equivalent to the $N_f$ channel $SU(M) \times SU(N_f)$
Coqblin-Schrieffer model. Solving numerically the scaling equations we find
that a realistic M-level system scales close to this fixed point (FP) and its
Kondo temperature is in the experimentally observable range $1-10 K$."
"We find the covariant deformed Heisenberg algebra and the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the extended $h$-deformed quantum plane and solve the Schr\""odinger
equations explicitly for some physical systems on the quantum plane. In the
commutative limit the behaviour of a quantum particle on the quantum plane
becomes that of the quantum particle on the Poincar\'e half-plane, a surface of
constant negative Gaussian curvature. We show the bound state energy spectra
for particles under specific potentials depend explicitly on the deformation
parameter $h$. Moreover, it is shown that bound states can survive on the
quantum plane in a limiting case where bound states on the Poincar\'e
half-plane disappear."
"The failure stresses and strains of nanotubes given by theoretical or
numerical predictions are much higher than observed in experiments. We show
that defects can explain part of this discrepancy: for an n-atom defect with
2<=n<=8, the range of failure stresses for a molecular mechanics calculation is
found to be 36GPa to 64GPa. This compares quite well with upper end of the
experimental failure stresses, 11GPa to 63GPa. The computed failure strains are
4% to 8%, whereas the experimental values are 2% to 13%. The underprediction of
failure strains can be explained by the slippage that occurred in the
experiments. The failure processes of nanotubes are clearly brittle in both the
experiments and our calculations."
"An approximate method to compute mean velocity profiles in turbulent flows is
developed. This approach is based on the equation connecting the Reynolds
stress and mean velocity. By using the measured values of pressure drop and
average (bulk) flow velocity, such characteristics of a turbulent flow as the
mean velocity and Reynolds stress distributions were calculated and compared
with the experimental measurements in different pipes and channels for various
fluids and gases. These show good agreement for a wide range of Reynolds
numbers."
"The problems in variation here concerned are such as to admit a continuous
group (in Lie's sense); the conclusions that emerge from the corresponding
differential equations find their most general expression in the theorems
formulated in Section 1 and proved in following sections. Concerning these
differential equations that arise from problems of variation, far more precise
statements can be made than about arbitrary differential equations admitting of
a group, which are the subject of Lie's researches. What is to follow,
therefore, represents a combination of the methods of the formal calculus of
variations with those of Lie's group theory. For special groups and problems in
variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel and
Herglotz for special finite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance
Fokker), Weyl and Klein for special infinite groups. Especially Klein's second
Note and the present developments have been mutually influenced by each other,
in which regard I may refer to the concluding remarks of Klein's Note."
"We discuss certain basic features of the equation-free (EF) approach to
modeling and computation for complex/multiscale systems. We focus on links
between the equation-free approach and tools from systems and control theory
(design of experiments, data analysis, estimation, identification and
feedback). As our illustrative example, we choose a specific numerical task
(the detection of stability boundaries in parameter space) for stochastic
models of two simplified heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. In the
equation-free framework the stochastic simulator is treated as an experiment
(albeit a computational one). Short bursts of fine scale simulation (short
computational experiments) are designed, executed, and their results processed
and fed back to the process, in integrated protocols aimed at performing the
particular coarse-grained task (the detection of a macroscopic instability).
Two distinct approaches are presented; one is a direct translation of our
previous protocol for adaptive detection of instabilities in laboratory
experiments (Rico-Martinez et al., 2003); the second approach is motivated from
numerical bifurcation algorithms for critical point detection. A comparison of
the two approaches brings forth a key feature of equation-free computation:
computational experiments can be easily initialized at will, in contrast to
laboratory ones."
"Some pressure and pressure-velocity correlation in a direct numerical
simulations of a three-dimensional turbulent flow at moderate Reynolds numbers
have been analyzed. We have identified a set of pressure-velocity correlations
which posseses a good scaling behaviour. Such a class of pressure-velocity
correlations are determined by looking at the energy-balance across any
sub-volume of the flow. According to our analysis, pressure scaling is
determined by the dimensional assumption that pressure behaves as a ``velocity
squared'', unless finite-Reynolds effects are overwhelming. The SO(3)
decompositions of pressure structure functions has also been applied in order
to investigate anisotropic effects on the pressure scaling."
"Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common algorithm used in photoacoustic (PA)
image formation. However, this algorithm results in a reconstructed image with
a wide mainlobe and high level of sidelobes. Minimum variance (MV), as an
adaptive beamformer, overcomes these limitations and improves the image
resolution and contrast. In this paper, a novel algorithm, named
modified-sparse-MV (MS-MV) is proposed in which a L1-norm constraint is added
to the MV minimization problem after some modifications, in order to suppress
the sidelobes more efficiently, compared to MV. The added constraint can be
interpreted as the sparsity of the output of the MV beamformed signals. Since
the final minimization problem is convex, it can be solved efficiently using a
simple iterative algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed
method, MS-MV beamformer, improves the signal-to-noise (SNR) about 19.48 dB, in
average, compared to MV. Also, the experimental results, using a wire-target
phantom, show that MS-MV leads to SNR improvement of about 2.64 dB in
comparison with the MV."
"We give a comprehensive self-contained review on the rigorous analysis of the
thermodynamics of a class of random spin systems of mean field type whose most
prominent example is the Hopfield model. We focus on the low temperature phase
and the analysis of the Gibbs measures with large deviation techniques. There
is a very detailed and complete picture in the regime of ``small $\a$''; a
particularly satisfactory result concerns a non-trivial regime of parameters in
which we prove 1) the convergence of the local ``mean fields'' to gaussian
random variables with constant variance and random mean; the random means are
from site to site independent gaussians themselves; 2) ``propagation of
chaos'', i.e. factorization of the extremal infinite volume Gibbs measures, and
3) the correctness of the ``replica symmetric solution'' of Amit, Gutfreund and
Sompolinsky [AGS]. This last result was first proven by M. Talagrand [T4],
using different techniques."
"Searches for weakly interacting massive particles(WIMP) can be based on the
dete ction of nuclear recoil energy in CsI(Tl) crystals. We demonstrate that
low energy gamma rays down to few keV is detected with CsI(Tl) crystal
detector. A clear peak at 6 keV is observed using X-ray source. Good energy
resolution and linearity have been achieved down to X-ray region. In addition,
we also show that alpha particles and gamma rays can be clearly separated using
the different time characteristics of the crystal."
"Throughout history, for reasons of health, well known personalities have
opted not to eat to satiety - to under-eat - with known benefits. Here, for the
benefits of under-eating a very simple explanation is offered and discussed in
some detail. Our distant ancestors, whose bodies we inherited, ate and weighed
a good deal less than we do. They had to run around every day to scour the
countryside for their scarce food, which kept them lean, hungry and healthy.
We, not so healthy relative over-weights, load up our shopping carts once a
week at the corner supermarket and simply eat too much for our ~50000-year-old
body design. Under-eating or not to eat one's fill appears to bring us somewhat
more in line with this design. Thereby, it causes our way of life to more
closely resemble the healthier one of our ancient forbears and enables us to
potentially live longer, to 100 and more. The putative underlying physiological
mechanisms for the health benefits of under-eating are of great interest and
therefore are touched upon here."
"In this paper a quantum mechanical phase space picture is constructed for
coarse-grained free quantum fields in an inflationary Universe. The appropriate
stochastic quantum Liouville equation is derived. Explicit solutions for the
phase space quantum distribution function are found for the cases of power law
and exponential expansions. The expectation values of dynamical variables with
respect to these solutions are compared to the corresponding cutoff regularized
field theoretic results (we do not restrict ourselves only to $\VEV{\F^2}$).
Fair agreement is found provided the coarse-graining scale is kept within
certain limits. By focusing on the full phase space distribution function
rather than a reduced distribution it is shown that the thermodynamic
interpretation of the stochastic formalism faces several difficulties (e.g.,
there is no fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The coarse-graining does not
guarantee an automatic classical limit as quantum correlations turn out to be
crucial in order to get results consistent with standard quantum field theory.
Therefore, the method does {\em not} by itself constitute an explanation of the
quantum to classical transition in the early Universe. In particular, we argue
that the stochastic equations do not lead to decoherence."
"We examine the long-time behaviour of A+B \to 0 reaction-diffusion systems
with initially separated species A and B. All of our analysis is carried out
for arbitrary (positive) values of the diffusion constant D_A of particles A
and initial concentrations a_0 and b_0 of A's and B's. We derive general
formulae for the location of the reaction zone centre, the total reaction rate,
and the concentration profile of species A outside the reaction zone. The
general properties of the reaction zone are studied with a help of the scaling
ansatz. Using the mean-field approximation we find the functional forms of
`tails' of the reaction rate R and the dependence of the width of the reaction
zone on the external parameters of the system. We also study the change in the
kinetics of the system with D_B > 0 in the limit D_B \to 0. Our results are
supported by numerical solutions of the mean-field reaction-diffusion equation."
"An optimal estimation inverse method is presented which can be used to
retrieve simultaneously vertical profiles of temperature and specific humidity,
in addition to surface pressure, from satellite-to-satellite radio occultation
observations of the Earth's atmosphere. The method is a non-linear, maximum
{\it a posteriori} technique which can accommodate most aspects of the real
radio occultation problem and is found to be stable and to converge rapidly in
most cases. The optimal estimation inverse method has two distinct advantages
over the analytic inverse method in that it accounts for some of the effects of
horizontal gradients and is able to retrieve optimally temperature and humidity
simultaneously from the observations. It is also able to account for
observation noise and other sources of error. Combined, these advantages ensure
a realistic retrieval of atmospheric quantities.
  A complete error analysis emerges naturally from the optimal estimation
theory, allowing a full characterisation of the solution. Using this analysis a
quality control scheme is implemented which allows anomalous retrieval
conditions to be recognised and removed, thus preventing gross retrieval
errors.
  The inverse method presented in this paper has been implemented for bending
angle measurements derived from GPS/MET radio occultation observations of the
Earth. Preliminary results from simulated data suggest that these observations
have the potential to improve NWP model analyses significantly throughout their
vertical range."
"We have examined polar magnetic fields for the last three solar cycles,
{$\it{viz.}$}, cycles 21, 22 and 23 using NSO Kitt Peak synoptic magnetograms.
In addition, we have used SoHO/MDI magnetograms to derive the polar fields
during cycle 23. Both Kitt Peak and MDI data at high latitudes
(78${^{\circ}}$--90${^{\circ}}$) in both solar hemispheres show a significant
drop in the absolute value of polar fields from the late declining phase of the
solar cycle 22 to the maximum of the solar cycle 23. We find that long term
changes in the absolute value of the polar field, in cycle 23, is well
correlated with changes in meridional flow speeds that have been reported
recently. We discuss the implication of this in influencing the extremely
prolonged minimum experienced at the start of the current cycle 24 and in
forecasting the behaviour of future solar cycles."
"We discuss the X-ray and optical properties of the massive galaxy cluster
MACSJ1206.2-0847 (z=0.4385), discovered in the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS).
Our Chandra observation of the system yields a total X-ray luminosity of 2.4 x
10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 keV) and a global gas temperature of (11.6 +/- 0.7) keV,
very high values typical of MACS clusters. In both optical and X-ray images
MACSJ1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced X-ray peak
at the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); we interpret this
feature as the remnant of a cold core. A spectacular giant gravitational arc,
15"" in length, bright (V~21) and unusually red (R-K=4.3), is seen 20"" west of
the BCG; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. From our HST
image of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as a
seven-fold imaged system. An excess of X-ray emission in the direction of the
arc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of a
minor merger with a group of galaxies. We derive estimates of the total cluster
mass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using X-ray, dynamical, and
gravitational-lensing techniques. For the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r<119
kpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on HST imaging yields a very high value
of 1.1 x 10^14 M_sun, inconsistent with the much lower X-ray estimate of 0.5 x
10^14 M_sun. Similarly, the virial estimate of 4 x 10^15 M_sun for the total
cluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy of 38 cluster members, is
significantly higher than the corresponding X-ray estimate of 1.7 x 10^15
M_sun. We take the discrepant mass estimates to be indicative of substructure
along the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation that
is supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km/s."
"We investigate the dynamics of monopole annihilation by the Langacker-Pi
mechanism. We find taht considerations of causality, flux-tube energetics and
the friction from Aharonov-Bohm scatteering suggest that the monopole
annihilation is most efficient if electromagnetism is spontaneously broken at
the lowest temperature ($T_{em} \approx 10^6 GeV$) consistent with not having
the monopoles dominate the energy density of the universe."
"The performance of speaker diarization is strongly affected by its clustering
algorithm at the test stage. However, it is known that clustering algorithms
are sensitive to random noises and small variations, particularly when the
clustering algorithms themselves suffer some weaknesses, such as bad local
minima and prior assumptions. To deal with the problem, a compact
representation of speech segments with small within-class variances and large
between-class distances is usually needed. In this paper, we apply an
unsupervised deep model, named multilayer bootstrap network (MBN), to further
process the embedding vectors of speech segments for the above problem. MBN is
an unsupervised deep model for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Unlike
traditional neural network based deep model, it is a stack of $k$-centroids
clustering ensembles, each of which is trained simply by random resampling of
data and one-nearest-neighbor optimization. We construct speaker diarization
systems by combining MBN with either the i-vector frontend or x-vector
frontend, and evaluated their effectiveness on a simulated NIST diarization
dataset, the AMI meeting corpus, and NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME database.
Experimental results show that the proposed systems are better than or at least
comparable to the systems that do not use MBN."
"We calculate the pair correlation function of an interacting Bose gas in a
harmonic trap directly via Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo simulation for
various temperatures and compare the numerical result with simple approximative
treatments. Around the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation, a
description based on the Hartree-Fock approximation is found to be accurate. At
low temperatures the Hartree-Fock approach fails and we use a local density
approximation based on the Bogoliubov description for a homogeneous gas. This
approximation agrees with the simulation results at low temperatures, where the
contribution of the phonon-like modes affects the long range behavior of the
correlation function. Further we discuss the relation between the pair
correlation and quantities measured in recent experiments."
"We study numerically and analytically the properties of the stationary state
of a particle moving under the influence of an electric field $\bE$ in a two
dimensional periodic Lorentz gas with the energy kept constant by a Gaussian
thermostat. Numerically the current appears to be a continuous function of
$\bE$ whose derivative varies very irregularly, possibly in a discontinuous
manner. We argue for the non differentibility of the current as a function of
$\bE$ utilizing a symbolic description of the dynamics based on the
discontinuities of the collision map. The decay of correlations and the
behavior of the diffusion constant are also investigated."
"Pairs of trapped atoms can be associated to make a diatomic molecule using a
time dependent magnetic field to ramp the energy of a scattering resonance
state from above to below the scattering threshold. A relatively simple model,
parameterized in terms of the background scattering length and resonance width
and magnetic moment, can be used to predict conversion probabilities from atoms
to molecules. The model and its Landau-Zener interpretation are described and
illustrated by specific calculations for $^{23}$Na, $^{87}$Rb, and $^{133}$Cs
resonances. The model can be readily adapted to Bose-Einstein condensates.
Comparison with full many-body calculations for the condensate case show that
the model is very useful for making simple estimates of molecule conversion
efficiencies."
"Neural source-filter (NSF) waveform models generate speech waveforms by
morphing sine-based source signals through dilated convolution in the time
domain. Although the sine-based source signals help the NSF models to produce
voiced sounds with specified pitch, the sine shape may constrain the generated
waveform when the target voiced sounds are less periodic. In this paper, we
propose a more flexible source signal called cyclic noise, a quasi-periodic
noise sequence given by the convolution of a pulse train and a static random
noise with a trainable decaying rate that controls the signal shape. We further
propose a masked spectral loss to guide the NSF models to produce periodic
voiced sounds from the cyclic noise-based source signal. Results from a
large-scale listening test demonstrated the effectiveness of the cyclic noise
and the masked spectral loss on speaker-independent NSF models in
copy-synthesis experiments on the CMU ARCTIC database."
"In the last years the Space Science community was confronted to a continuous
increasing interest in Martian missions, extra-solar planet search and
multi-satellite missions. The presented T.I.P.O. mission is a proposal for a
research program dedicated to study, by space borne interferometric methods,
the radio emissions generated in the atmospheres and magnetospheres of planets,
both solar and extra-solar."
"Cellular automata are widely used to model natural or artificial systems.
Classically they are run with perfect synchrony, i.e., the local rule is
applied to each cell at each time step. A possible modification of the updating
scheme consists in applying the rule with a fixed probability, called the
synchrony rate. For some particular rules, varying the synchrony rate
continuously produces a qualitative change in the behaviour of the cellular
automaton. We investigate the nature of this change of behaviour using
Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that this phenomenon is a second-order phase
transition, which we characterise more specifically as belonging to the
directed percolation or to the parity conservation universality classes studied
in statistical physics."
"Dynamics of double membrane films is investigated in the long-wavelength
limit including the overdamped squeezing mode. We demonstrate that thermal
fluctuations essentially modify the character of the mode due to its nonlinear
coupling to the transversal shear hydrodynamic mode. The corresponding Green
function acquires as a function of the frequency a cut along the imaginary
semi-axis. Fluctuations lead to increasing the attenuation of the squeezing
mode it becomes larger than the `bare' value."
"We present two arguments indicating that the large value for the $\epsilon_1$
mixing parameter at 50 MeV, which the Basel group extracted from their recent
$A_{zz}$ measurement, may be incorrect. First, there are nucleon-nucleon (NN)
potentials which predict the $\epsilon_1$ at 50 MeV substantially below the
Basel value and reproduce the Basel $A_{zz}$ data accurately. Second, the large
value for $\epsilon_1$ at 50 MeV proposed by the Basel group can only be
explained by a model for the NN interaction which is very unrealistic (no
$\rho$-meson and essentially a point-like $\pi NN$ vertex) and overpredicts the
$\epsilon_1$ in the energy range where it is well determined (150--500 MeV) by
a factor of two."
"Turn-taking behaviour is simulated in a coupled agents system. Each agent is
modelled as a mobile robot with two wheels. A recurrent neural network is used
to produce the motor outputs and to hold the internal dynamics. Agents are
developed to take turns on a two-dimensional arena by causing the network
structures to evolve.
  Turn-taking is established using either regular or chaotic behaviour of the
agents. It is found that chaotic turn-takers are more sensitive to the adaptive
inputs from the other agent. Conversely, regular turn-takers are comparatively
robust against noisy inputs, owing to their restricted dynamics. From many
observations, including turn-taking with virtual agents, we claim that there is
a complementary relationship between robustness and adaptability. Furthermore,
by investigating the recoupling of agents from different GA generations, we
report the emergence of a new turn-taking behaviour. Potential for synthesizing
a new form of motion is another characteristic of chaotic turn-takers."
"We present a method to derive an upper bound for the entropy density of
coupled map lattices with local interactions from local observations. To do
this, we use an embedding technique being a combination of time delay and
spatial embedding. This embedding allows us to identify the local character of
the equations of motion. Based on this method we present an approximate
estimate of the entropy density by the correlation integral."
"We consider a partially spin-polarized atomic Fermi gas in a
high-aspect-ratio trap, with a flux of predominantly spin-up atoms exiting the
center of the trap. We argue that such a scenario can be produced by
evaporative cooling, and we find that it can result in a substantially
non-equilibrium polarization pattern for typical experimental parameters. We
offer this as a possible explanation for the quantitative discrepancies in
recent experiments on spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases."
"The quantum Hall system in the lowest Landau level with Zeeman term is
studied by a two-state model, which has a chiral invariance. Using a
diagrammatic analysis, we examine this two-state model with random impurity
scattering, and find the exact value of the conductivity at the Zeeman energy
$E = \Delta$. We further study the conductivity at the another extended state
$E = E_1$ ($ E_1 > \Delta$). We find that the values of the conductivities at
$E = 0$ and $E = E_1$ do not depend upon the value of the Zeeman energy
$\Delta$. We discuss also the case where the Zeeman energy $\Delta$ becomes a
random field."
"Swarm Intelligence (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective
behaviors of (unsophisticated) entities interacting locally with their
environment cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge. SI provides a
basis with which it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem
solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. To
tackle the formation of a coherent social collective intelligence from
individual behaviors, we discuss several concepts related to self-organization,
stigmergy and social foraging in animals. Then, in a more abstract level we
suggest and stress the role played not only by the environmental media as a
driving force for societal learning, as well as by positive and negative
feedbacks produced by the many interactions among agents. Finally, presenting a
simple model based on the above features, we will address the collective
adaptation of a social community to a cultural (environmental, contextual) or
media informational dynamical landscape, represented here - for the purpose of
different experiments - by several three-dimensional mathematical functions
that suddenly change over time. Results indicate that the collective
intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even
when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to
deal with two different and contradictory purposes. KEYWORDS: Swarm

"In this work we study the eigenstates and the energy spectra of a generic
billiard system with the use of microwave resonators. This is possible due to
the exact correspondence between the Schroedinger equation and the electric
field equations of the lowest modes in thin microwave resonators. We obtain a
good agreement between the numerical (exact) and experimental eigenstates,
while the short range experimental spectral statistics show the expected
Brody-like behaviour in this energy range, as opposed to the Berry-Robnik
picture which is valid only in the semiclassical region of sufficiently small
effective Planck's constant."
"We describe a new sample of 226 GPS (GHz-Peaked Spectrum) source candidates
selected using simultaneous 1-22 GHz multi-frequency observations with the
RATAN-600 radio telescope. Sixty objects in our sample are identified as GPS
source candidates for the first time. The candidates were selected on the basis
of their broad-band radio spectra only. We discuss the spectral and variability
properties of selected objects of different optical classes."
"Negative ion detachment in two-colour laser field is considered within the
recent modification of Keldysh model which makes it quantitatively reliable.
The general approach is illustrated by calculation of angular differential
detachment rates, partial rates for particular ATD (Above Threshold Detachment)
channels and total detachment rates for H$^-$ ion in bichromatic field with 1:2
frequency ratio. Both perturbative and strong field regimes are examined. Polar
asymmetry and phase effects are quantitatively characterized with some new
features revealed. Phase effects are found to result in a huge anisotropy
factor $\sim 10^3$ in the electron angular distribution in the perturbative
regime."
"Collocated measurements of the mass concentrations of aerosol black carbon
(BC) and composite aerosols near the surface were carried out along with
spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) from a high altitude station, Manora
Peak in Central Himalayas, during a comprehensive aerosol field campaign in
December 2004. Despite being a pristine location in the Shivalik Ranges of
Central Himalayas, and having a monthly mean AOD (at 500 nm) of 0.059 $\pm$
0.033 (typical to this site), total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration
was in the range 15 - 40 micro g m^(-3) (mean value 27.1 $\pm$ 8.3 micro g
m^(-3)). Interestingly, aerosol BC had a mean concentration of 1.36 $\pm$ 0.99
micro g m^(-3), contributed to ~5.0 $\pm$ 1.3 % to the composite aerosol mass.
This large abundance of BC is found to have linkages to the human activities in
the adjoining valley and to the boundary layer dynamics. Consequently, the
inferred single scattering albedo lies in the range of 0.87 to 0.94 (mean value
0.90 $\pm$ 0.03), indicating significant aerosol absorption. The estimated
aerosol radiative forcing was as low as 4.2 W m^(-2) at the surface, +0.7 W
m^(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, implying an atmospheric forcing of +4.9 W
m^(-2). Though absolute value of the atmospheric forcing is quite small, which
arises primarily from the very low AOD (or the column abundance of aerosols),
the forcing efficiency (forcing per unit optical depth) was $\sim$88 W m^(-2),
which is attributed to the high BC mass fraction."
"In recent years, speech enhancement (SE) has achieved impressive progress
with the success of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the DNN approach
usually fails to generalize well to unseen environmental noise that is not
included in the training. To address this problem, we propose ""noise tokens""
(NTs), which are a set of neural noise templates that are jointly trained with
the SE system. NTs dynamically capture the environment variability and thus
enable the DNN model to handle various environments to produce STFT magnitude
with higher quality. Experimental results show that using NTs is an effective
strategy that consistently improves the generalization ability of SE systems
across different DNN architectures. Furthermore, we investigate applying a
state-of-the-art neural vocoder to generate waveform instead of traditional
inverse STFT (ISTFT). Subjective listening tests show the residual noise can be
significantly suppressed through mel-spectrogram correction and vocoder-based
waveform synthesis."
"We investigate electronic and optical properties of the V-based ladder
compounds NaV2O5, the iso-structural CaV2O5, as well as MgV2O5, which differs
from NaV2O5 and CaV2O5 in the c axis stacking. We calculate ab initio the A_g
phonon modes in these compounds as a basis for the investigation of the
electron-phonon and spin-phonon coupling. The phonon modes together with the
dielectric tensors as a function of the corresponding ion displacements are the
starting point for the calculation of the A_g Raman scattering."
"We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II
supernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are
explored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which
treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux
dilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical
when their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type
II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty
introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than
10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10
supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN
1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide
range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing
the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101
and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from
Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is
larger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness
fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher
method. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive
a value of $H_0 = 60 \pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to
errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved
by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II
supernovae."
"Recent experiments on conduction between a semiconductor and a superconductor
have revealed a variety of new mesoscopic phenomena. Here is a review of the
present status of this rapidly developing field. A scattering theory is
described which leads to a conductance formula analogous to Landauer's formula
in normal-state conduction. The theory is used to identify features in the
conductance which can serve as ""signatures"" of phase-coherent Andreev
reflection, i.e. for which the phase coherence of the electrons and the
Andreev-reflected holes is essential. The applications of the theory include a
quantum point contact, quantum dot, weak localization, universal conductance
fluctuations, shot noise, and reflectionless tunneling. This review is based on
lectures at the Les Houches summer school, Session LXI, 1994."
"The detection of lower mass planets now being reported via radial velocity
and microlensing surveys suggests that they may be ubiquitous. If missions such
as Kepler are able to confirm this, the detection and study of rocky planets
via direct imaging with ground-based telescopes of apertures > 20 m is feasible
in the thermal infrared. We discuss two cases for detecting rocky planets, the
first via detection of molten Earths formed though an Earth-Moon like impact
event, and the second via detection of planets around very nearby stars. These
observations have the potential to give us a first look at a rocky planet
similar to the Earth."
"The problem of a differential operator left- and right division is solved in
terms of generalized Bell polinomials for nonabelian differential unitary ring.
The definition of the polinomials is made by means of recurrent relations. The
expresions of classic Bell polinomils via generalized one is given. The
conditions of an exact factorization possibility leads to the intertwine
relation and results in some linearizable generalized Burgers equation. An
alternative proof of the Matveev theorem is given and Darboux - Matveev
transformations formula for coefficients follows from the intertwine relations
and also expressed in the generalized Bell polinomials."
"Deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement ordinarily requires clean
speech signals as the training target. However, collecting clean signals is
very costly because they must be recorded in a studio. This requirement
currently restricts the amount of training data for speech enhancement to less
than 1/1000 of that of speech recognition which does not need clean signals.
Increasing the amount of training data is important for improving the
performance, and hence the requirement of clean signals should be relaxed. In
this paper, we propose a training strategy that does not require clean signals.
The proposed method only utilizes noisy signals for training, which enables us
to use a variety of speech signals in the wild. Our experimental results showed
that the proposed method can achieve the performance similar to that of a DNN
trained with clean signals."
"It has been proposed to realize secure communication using chaotic
synchronization via transmission of binary message encoded by parameter
modulation in the chaotic system. This paper considers the use of parameter
adaptive control techniques to extract the message, based on the assumptions
that we know the equation form of the chaotic system in the transmitter but do
not have access to the precise values of the parameters which are kept secret
as a secure set. In the case that a synchronizing system can be constructed
using parameter adaptive control by the transmitted signal and the
synchronization is robust to parameter mismatches, the parameter modulation can
be revealed and the message decoded without resorting to exact parameter values
in the secure set. A practical local Lyapunov function method for designing
parameter adaptive control rules based on originally synchronized systems is
presented."
"The two published lithium peroxide structures, both ascribed to the hexagonal
P -6 space group, were subjected to reinterpretation and another more symmetric
structure, now belonging to the P 63/m m c space group, was found. Detailed
density-functional quantum mechanical calculations and crystal structure
optimisations were carried out on both structures and the energetic arguments
obtained therewith helped to rule out one of them."
"We present the preliminary results of a systematic search for GRB and other
transients in the publicly available data for the IBIS/PICsIT (0.2-10 MeV)
detector on board INTEGRAL. Lightcurves in 2-8 energy bands with time
resolution from 1 to 62.5 ms have been collected and an analysis of spectral
and temporal characteristics has been performed. This is the nucleus of a
forthcoming first catalog of GRB observed by PICsIT."
"We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman
scattering and fluorescence focusing on the interplay between electromagnetic
effects and the molecular dynamics. Our model molecule is placed close to two
Ag nanoparticles, and has two electronic levels. A Franck-Condon mechanism
provides electron-vibration coupling. Using realistic parameter values for the
molecule we find that an electromagnetic enhancement by 10 orders of magnitude
can yield Raman cross-sections $\sigma_{R}$ of the order $10^{-14}
\unit{cm^2}$. We also discuss the dependence of $\sigma_{R}$ on incident laser
intensity."
"This paper gives an overview of a reconstruction algorithm for muon events in
ATLAS experiment at CERN. After a short introduction on ATLAS Muon
Spectrometer, we will describe the procedure performed by the algorithms
Muonbox and Muonboy (last version) in order to achieve correctly the
reconstruction task. These algorithms have been developed in Fortran language
and are working in the official C++ framework Athena, as well as in stand alone
mode. A description of the interaction between Muonboy and Athena will be
given, together with the reconstruction performances (efficiency and momentum
resolution) obtained with MonteCarlo data."
"We have developed a fast programmable trigger processor board based on a
field programmable gate array and a complex programmable logic device for use
in the BELLE experiment. The trigger board accommodates 144 ECL input signals,
2 NIM input signals, 24 ECL output signals, and the VME bus specification. An
asynchronous trigger logic for counting isolated clusters is used. We have
obtained trigger latency of 50 ns with a full access to input and output
signals via a VME interface. The trigger logic can be modified at any time
depending on the experimental conditions."
"The final fate of massive stars depends on many factors, including mass,
rotation rate, magnetic fields and metallicity. Theory suggests that some
massive stars (initially greater than 25-30 solar masses) end up as Wolf-Rayet
stars which are deficient in hydrogen because of mass loss through strong
stellar winds. The most massive of these stars have cores which may form a
black hole and theory predicts that the resulting explosion produces ejecta of
low kinetic energy, a faint optical display and a small mass fraction of
radioactive nickel(1,2,3). An alternative origin for low energy supernovae is
the collapse of the oxygen-neon core of a relatively lowmass star (7-9 solar
masses) through electron capture(4,5). However no weak, hydrogen deficient,
core-collapse supernovae are known. Here we report that such faint, low energy
core-collapse supernovae do exist, and show that SN2008ha is the faintest
hydrogen poor supernova ever observed. We propose that other similar events
have been observed but they have been misclassified as peculiar thermonuclear
supernovae (sometimes labelled SN2002cx-like events(6)). This discovery could
link these faint supernovae to some long duration gamma-ray bursts. Extremely
faint, hydrogen-stripped core-collapse supernovae have been proposed to produce
those long gamma-ray bursts whose afterglows do not show evidence of
association with supernovae (7,8,9)."
"We use a $\lambda\Phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory to illustrate a new
approach to the study of quantum to classical transition. In this approach, the
decoherence functional is employed to assign probabilities to consistent
histories defined in terms of correlations among the fields at separate points,
rather than the field itself. We present expressions for the quantum amplitudes
associated with such histories, as well as for the decoherence functional
between two of them. The dynamics of an individual consistent history may be
described by a Langevin-type equation, which we derive. \noindent {\it

"We present a quantum interpretation of the heights in hysteresis of $Fe_{8}$
molecule at lower temperatures by treating the crystal as an Ising spin system
with the dipolar interaction between spins. Then we apply it to two limit cases
: rapid and adiabatic regions. Our theoretical analysis is in agreement with
the experimental observation in these regions, which indicates that the steps
in hysteresis loops of magnetization of Fe$_{8}$ at lower temperatures show a
pure quantum process."
"AliEn (ALICE Environment) is a GRID-like system for large scale job
submission and distributed data management developed and used in the context of
ALICE, the CERN LHC heavy-ion experiment. With the aim of exploiting upcoming
Grid resources to run AliEn-managed jobs and store the produced data, the
problem of AliEn-EDG interoperability was addressed and an in-terface was
designed. One or more EDG (European Data Grid) User Interface machines run the
AliEn software suite (Cluster Monitor, Storage Element and Computing Element),
and act as interface nodes between the systems. An EDG Resource Broker is seen
by the AliEn server as a single Computing Element, while the EDG storage is
seen by AliEn as a single, large Storage Element; files produced in EDG sites
are registered in both the EDG Replica Catalogue and in the AliEn Data
Catalogue, thus ensuring accessibility from both worlds. In fact, both
registrations are required: the AliEn one is used for the data management, the
EDG one to guarantee the integrity and access to EDG produced data. A prototype
interface has been successfully deployed using the ALICE AliEn Server and the
EDG and DataTAG Testbeds."
"Although most insulators are expected to undergo insulator to metal
transition on lattice compression, tetrahedral semiconductors Si, GaAs and InSb
can become metallic on compression as well as by expansion. We focus on the
transition by expansion which is rather peculiar; in all cases the direct gap
at $\Gamma$ point closes on expansion and thereafter a zero-gap state persists
over a wide range of lattice constant. The solids become metallic at an
expansion of 13 % to 15 % when an electron fermi surface around L-point and a
hole fermi surface at $\Gamma$-point develop. We provide an understanding of
this behavior in terms of arguments based on symmetry and simple tight-binding
considerations. We also report results on the critical behavior of conductivity
in the metal phase and the static dielectric constant in the insulating phase
and find common behaviour. We consider the possibility of excitonic phases and
distortions which might intervene between insulating and metallic phases."
"[abridged] It has been widely claimed that several lines of observational
evidence point towards a ""downsizing"" (DS) of the process of galaxy formation
over cosmic time. This behavior is sometimes termed ""anti-hierarchical"", and
contrasted with the ""bottom-up"" assembly of the dark matter structures in Cold
Dark Matter models. In this paper we address three different kinds of
observational evidence that have been described as DS: the stellar mass
assembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in local
galaxies. We compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with the
predictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within
the Lambda-CDM framework. In the data, we see only weak evidence at best of DS
in stellar mass and in star formation rate. We find that, when observational
errors on stellar mass and SFR are taken into account, the models acceptably
reproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift range
that we consider. However, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in the
models and are too passive at late times. Thus, the models do not correctly
reproduce the DS trend in stellar mass or the archaeological DS, while they
qualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the SFR. We demonstrate
that these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellite
galaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation of
central galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200
km/s. [abridged]"
"Spin correlations in metallic and insulating phases of $V_2O_3$ and its
derivatives are investigated using magnetic neutron scattering. Metallic
samples have incommensurate spin correlations varying little with hole doping.
Paramagnetic insulating samples have spin correlations only among near
neighbors. The transition from either of these phases into the low temperature
insulating antiferromagnetic phase is accompanied by an abrupt change of
dynamic magnetic short range order. Our results support the idea that the
transition into the antiferromagnetic insulator is also an orbital ordering
transition."
"A general analysis of squeezing transformations for two mode systems is given
based on the four dimensional real symplectic group $Sp(4,\Re)\/$. Within the
framework of the unitary metaplectic representation of this group, a
distinction between compact photon number conserving and noncompact photon
number nonconserving squeezing transformations is made. We exploit the
$Sp(4,\Re)-SO(3,2)\/$ local isomorphism and the $U(2)\/$ invariant squeezing
criterion to divide the set of all squeezing transformations into a two
parameter family of distinct equivalence classes with representative elements
chosen for each class. Familiar two mode squeezing transformations in the
literature are recognized in our framework and seen to form a set of measure
zero. Examples of squeezed coherent and thermal states are worked out. The need
to extend the heterodyne detection scheme to encompass all of $U(2)\/$ is
emphasized, and known experimental situations where all $U(2)\/$ elements can
be reproduced are briefly described."
"I consider the N-step transfer matrix T for a general block Hamiltonian, with
eigenvalue equation
  L_n \psi_{n+1} + H_n \psi_n + L_{n-1}^\dagger \psi_{n-1} = E \psi_n
  where H_n and L_n are matrices, and provide its explicit representation in
terms of blocks of the resolvent of the Hamiltonian matrix for the system of
length N with boundary conditions \psi_0 =\psi_{N+1} =0. I then introduce the
related Hamiltonian for the case \psi_0 = z^{-1} \psi_N and \psi_{N+1} = z
\psi_1, and provide an exact relation between the trace of its resolvent and
Tr(T-z)^{-1}, together with an identity of Thouless type connecting Tr(\log
|T|) with the Hamiltonian eigenvalues for z=e^{i\phi}. The results are then
extended to T^\dagger T by showing that it is itself a transfer matrix. Besides
their own mathematical interest, the identities should be useful for an
analytical approach in the study of spectral properties of a physically
relevant class of transfer matrices.

"Context: The HD and H2 molecules play important roles in the cooling of
primordial and very metal-poor gas at high redshift. Aims: Grain surface and
gas phase formation of HD and H2 is investigated to assess the importance of
trace amounts of dust, 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Zo, in the production of HD and H2.
Methods: We consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include both
physisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surface
barriers. We find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemical
and thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10^{-5} solar lead to a
strong boost in the H2 formation rate due to surface reactions. As a result of
this enhancement in H2, HD is formed more efficiently in the gas phase through
the D+ + H2 reaction. Direct formation of HD on dust grains cannot compete well
with this gas phase process for dust temperatures below 150 K. We also derive
up-to-date analytic fitting formulae for the grain surface formation of H2 and
HD, including the different binding energies of H and D. Results: Grain surface
reactions are crucial to the availability of H2 and HD in very metal-poor
environments. Above metallicities of 10^{-5} solar, the grain surface route
dominates the formation of H2, which in turn, drives the formation of HD in the
gas phase. At dust temperatures above 150 K, laboratory experiments and
theoretical modelling suggest that H2 formation on grains is suppressed while
HD formation on grains is not."
"In two companion papers it was shown how to separate out from a scattering
function in quantum electrodynamics a distinguished part that meets the
correspondence-principle and pole-factorization requirements. The integrals
that define the terms of the remainder are here shown to have singularities on
the pertinent Landau singularity surface that are weaker than those of the
distinguished part. These remainder terms therefore vanish, relative to the
distinguished term, in the appropriate macroscopic limits. This shows, in each
order of the perturbative expansion, that quantum electrodynamics does indeed
satisfy the pole-factorization and correspondence-principle requirements in the
case treated here. It also demonstrates the efficacy of the computational
techniques developed here to calculate the consequences of the principles of
quantum electrodynamics in the macroscopic and mesoscopic regimes."
"The main features of radiation by relativistic electrons are well
approximated in the Weizsacker-Williams method of virtual quanta. This method
is best known for its application to radiation during elementary particle
collisions, but is equally useful in describing ""classical"" radiation emitted
during the interaction of a single relativistic electron with an extended
system, such as synchrotron radiation, undulator radiation, transition
radiation and Cerenkov radiation."
"The spread of ensemble weather forecasts contains information about the
spread of possible future weather scenarios. But how much information does it
contain, and how useful is that information in predicting the probabilities of
future temperatures? One traditional answer to this question is to calculate
the spread-skill correlation. We discuss the spread-skill correlation and how
it interacts with some simple calibration schemes. We then point out why it is
not, in fact, a useful measure for the amount of information in the ensemble
spread, and discuss a number of other measures that are more useful."
"We consider an isolated gaseous system, divided in two parts by an adiabatic
movable frictionless internal wall undergoing Brownian motion. We show how this
kind of motion can lead to a substantial decrease of the system entropy. This
surprising result does not violate Boltzmann's H-theorem since the molecular
chaos assumption underlying H-theorem is not fulfilled by our system."
"We examine the stability of a class of solitons, obtained from a
generalization of the Boussinesq equation, which have been proposed to be
relevant for pulse propagation in biomembranes and nerves. These solitons are
found to be stable with respect to small amplitude fluctuations. They emerge
naturally from non-solitonic initial excitations and are robust in the presence
of dissipation."
"A simple theory of the Rydberg atoms ionisation by electromagnetic pulses and
microwave field is presented. The analysis is based on the scale transformation
which reduces the number of parameters and reveals the functional dependencies
of the processes. It is shown that the observed ionisation of Rydberg atoms by
subpicosecond electromagnetic pulses scale classically. The threshold electric
field required to ionise a Rydberg state may be simply evaluated in the
photonic basis approach for the quantum dynamics or from the multiphoton
ionisation theory."
"In the selective withdrawal experiment fluid is withdrawn through a tube with
its tip suspended a distance S above a two-fluid interface. At sufficiently low
withdrawal rates, Q, the interface forms a steady state hump and only the upper
fluid is withdrawn. When Q is increased (or S decreased), the interface
undergoes a transition so that the lower fluid is entrained with the upper one,
forming a thin steady-state spout. Near this transition the hump curvature
becomes very large and displays power-law scaling behavior. This scaling allows
for steady-state hump profiles at different flow rates and tube heights to be
scaled onto a single similarity profile. I show that the scaling behavior is
independent of the viscosity ratio."
"We describe the implementation of analytical Hartree-Fock gradients for
periodic systems in the code CRYSTAL, emphasizing the technical aspects of this
task. The code is now capable of calculating analytical derivatives with
respect to nuclear coordinates for systems periodic in 0, 1, 2 and 3 dimensions
(i.e. molecules, polymers, slabs and solids). Both closed-shell restricted and
unrestricted Hartree-Fock gradients have been implemented. A comparison with
numerical derivatives shows that the forces are highly accurate."
"New aspects of turbulence are uncovered if one considers flow motion from the
perspective of a fluid particle (known as the Lagrangian approach) rather than
in terms of a velocity field (the Eulerian viewpoint). Using a new experimental
technique, based on the scattering of ultrasounds, we have obtained a direct
measurement of particle velocities, resolved at all scales, in a fully
turbulent flow. It enables us to approach intermittency in turbulence from a
dynamical point of view and to analyze the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations in
the framework of random walks. We find experimentally that the elementary steps
in the 'walk' have random uncorrelated directions but a magnitude that is
extremely long-range correlated in time. Theoretically, we study a Langevin
equation that incorporates these features and we show that the resulting
dynamics accounts for the observed one- and two-point statistical properties of
the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations. Our approach connects the intermittent
statistical nature of turbulence to the dynamics of the flow."
"Prompt, in-beam $\gamma$ rays following the reaction $^{170}$Yb + 142 MeV
$^{28}$Si were measured at the ATLAS facility using 10 Compton-suppressed Ge
detectors and the Fragment Mass Analyzer. Transitions in $^{194}$Po were
identified and placed using $\gamma$-ray singles and coincidence data gated on
the mass of the evaporation residues. A level spectrum up to
J$\approx$10$\hbar$ was established. The structure of $^{194}$Po is more
collective than that observed in the heavier polonium isotopes and indicates
that the structure has started to evolve towards the more collective nature
expected for deformed nuclei."
"Optimum implementation of non-conventional wells allows us to increase
considerably hydrocarbon recovery. By considering the high drilling cost and
the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an
important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and
high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most
suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an
optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory
based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which
is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful
derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the
optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive
penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints.
(2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into
CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the
number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several
examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm
incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach
outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and
a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations."
"An accelerator experiment was performed using a low-energy antiproton beam to
measure antiproton detection efficiency of BESS, a balloon-borne spectrometer
with a superconducting solenoid. Measured efficiencies showed good agreement
with calculated ones derived from the BESS Monte Carlo simulation based on
GEANT/GHEISHA. With detailed verification of the BESS simulation, the relative
systematic error of detection efficiency derived from the BESS simulation has
been determined to be $\pm$5%, compared with the previous estimation of
$\pm$15% which was the dominant uncertainty for measurements of cosmic-ray
antiproton flux."
"Hamiltonian tridiagonal matrices characterized by multi-fractal spectral
measures in the family of Iterated Function Systems can be constructed by a
recursive technique here described. We prove that these Hamiltonians are
almost-periodic. They are suited to describe quantum lattice systems with
nearest neighbours coupling, as well as chains of linear classical oscillators,
and electrical transmission lines.
  We investigate numerically and theoretically the time dynamics of the systems
so constructed. We derive a relation linking the long-time, power-law behaviour
of the moments of the position operator, expressed by a scaling function
$\beta$ of the moment order $\alpha$, and spectral multi-fractal dimensions,
D_q, via $\beta(\alpha) = D_{1-\alpha}$. We show cases in which this relation
is exact, and cases where it is only approximate, unveiling the reasons for the
discrepancies."
"Mammography is widely recognized as the most reliable technique for early
detection of breast cancers. Automated or semi-automated computerized
classification schemes can be very useful in assisting radiologists with a
second opinion about the visual diagnosis of breast lesions, thus leading to a
reduction in the number of unnecessary biopsies. We present a computer-aided
diagnosis (CADi) system for the characterization of massive lesions in
mammograms, whose aim is to distinguish malignant from benign masses. The CADi
system we realized is based on a three-stage algorithm: a) a segmentation
technique extracts the contours of the massive lesion from the image; b)
sixteen features based on size and shape of the lesion are computed; c) a
neural classifier merges the features into an estimated likelihood of
malignancy. A dataset of 226 massive lesions (109 malignant and 117 benign) has
been used in this study. The system performances have been evaluated terms of
the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, obtaining A_z =
0.80+-0.04 as the estimated area under the ROC curve."
"The heuristic principle that constructive dynamics may arise wherever there
exists a difference, or gradient, is discussed. Consideration of black-hole
entropy appears to provide a clue for setting a lower bound on any extensive
measure of such collective system difference, or potential to give rise to
constructive dynamics. It is seen that the second-power dependence of
black-hole entropy on mass is consistent with the difference principle, while
consideration of Hawking radiation forces one to beware of implicit
figure-ground distinctions in the application of the difference principle."
"In studies on Marangoni type motion of particles the surface tension is often
approximated as a linear function of temperature. For deformable particles in a
linear external temperature gradient far from the reference point this
approximation yields a negative surface tension which is physically
unrealistic. It is shown that H.Zhou and R.H.Davis J. Colloid Interface Sci.,
n.181,60,1996 presented calculation where the leading deformable drop moved
into a region of negative surface tension. With respect numerical studies the
restriction of the migration of two deformable drops is given in terms of the
drift time."
"The energy-balance model of global climate, which is taking into account a
nontrivial role of solar and galactic protons, is presented. The model is
described by the equation of fold catastrophe relative to increment of
temperature, where the variation of a solar insolation and cosmic rays are
control parameters. It is shown that the bifurcation equation of the model
describes one of two stable states of the climate system. The solution of this
equation exhibits the property of the determined bistable behavior of climate
at the global level and the possibility of appearance of the determined chaos
of ""the weathers"" at the local levels. The results of the comparative analysis
of the computer simulation of the time-dependent solution of energy-balance
model of global climate and the oxygen isotope records for deep-sea core
V28-238 over the past 730 kyr are presented, and the evolution of climate on
100 kyr forward is also predicted. It is shown that the proposed model
successfully explains the nicety of the paleoclimatic records. The model is
clear of all known difficulties of the Milankovich theory for the analysis and
the interpretation of physical mechanism, by which the climate system responds
to orbital forcing."
"The recursion and path-integral methods are applied to analytically study the
electronic structure of a neutral $C_{60}$ molecule. We employ a tight-binding
Hamiltonian which considers both the $s$ and $p$ valence electrons of carbon.
From the recursion method, we obtain closed-form {\it analytic} expressions for
the $\pi$ and $\sigma$ eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, including the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) states, and the Green's functions. We also present the local densities
of states around several ring clusters, which can be probed experimentally by
using, for instance, a scanning tunneling microscope. {}From a path-integral
method, identical results for the energy spectrum are also derived. In
addition, the local density of states on one carbon atom is obtained; from this
we can derive the degree of degeneracy of the energy levels."
"The order of `noun and adposition' is the important parameter of word
ordering rules in the world's languages. The seven parameters, `adverb and
verb' and others, have a strong dependence on the `noun and adposition'.
Japanese as well as Korean, Tamil and several other languages seem to have a
stable structure of word ordering rules, as well as Thai and other languages
which have the opposite word ordering rules to Japanese. It seems that each
language in the world fluctuates between these two structures like the Ising
model for finite lattice."
"This paper theoretically analyzes the hydrodynamic shape stability problem
for sonoluminescing bubbles. We present a semianalytical approach to describe
the evolution of shape perturbations in the strongly nonlinear regime of
violent collapse. The proposed approximation estimating the damping rate
produced by liquid viscosity is used to elucidate the influence of the collapse
phase on subsequent evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We
demonstrate that time derivatives of shape perturbations grow significantly as
the bubble radius vanishes, forming the dominant contribution to
destabilization during the ensuing bounce phase. By this effect the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be enhanced drastically, yielding a viable
explanation of the upper threshold of driving pressure experimentally observed
by Barber et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1380 (1994)]."
"The emergence of districts in nanotechnology represents a new pattern of
scientific development. The factors affecting their growth are analysed to
understand the drivers of economic development. By analyzing the top 200
nano-districts, Nanotrendchart sheds light on the clusterization process:
academic production is seen to be highly concentrated, with fifteen districts
representing over half of published articles; Asian districts are clearly
growing significantly faster than those elsewhere; and district growth in the
domain of engineering and physics is more rapid than in other disciplines.
Scientific diversity, actors diversity as well as the degree of openness of the
cluster influence their evolution. Highly specialised clusters witness lower
growth rates"
"Excited negative parity hyperon masses are calculated in a chiral bag model
in which the pion and the kaon fields are treated as perturbations. We also
calculate the hadronic widths of $\lama$ and $\lamb$ as well as the coupling
constants of the lightest $I=0$ excited hyperon to the meson-baryon channels,
and discuss how the dispersive effects of the hadronic meson-baryon decay
channels affect the excited hyperon masses. Meson cloud corrections to the
electromagnetic decay widths of the two lightest excited hyperons into ground
states $\lamz$ and $\sigz$ are calculated within the same model and are found
to be small. Our results strengthen the argument that predictions of these
hyperon radiative decay widths provide an excellent test for various quark
models of hadrons."
"We study the differential forms over the frame bundle of the based loop
space. They are stochastics in the sense that we put over this frame bundle a
probability measure. In order to understand the curvatures phenomena which
appear when we look at the Lie bracket of two horizontal vector fields, we
impose some regularity assumptions over the kernels of the differential forms.
This allows us to define an exterior stochastic differential derivative over
these forms."
"This Letter of Intent to the Fermilab Program Advisory Committee describes a
search for neutrino oscillations at the Fermilab booster. It is motivated by
the LSND observation of nu_mu -> nu_e appearance. The booster neutrino
experiment (BooNE) will be capable of observing both nu_mu -> nu_e appearance
and nu_mu disappearance. In addition, the experiment will be able to measure
Delta m^2 and sin^2(2theta) and search for CP violation in the lepton sector."
"We present high resolution simulations on the impact of ionizing radiation of
massive O-stars on the surrounding turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). The
simulations are performed with the newly developed software iVINE which
combines ionization with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and
gravitational forces. We show that radiation from hot stars penetrates the ISM,
efficiently heats cold low density gas and amplifies over-densities seeded by
the initial turbulence. The formation of observed pillar-like structures in
star forming regions (e.g. in M16) can be explained by this scenario. At the
tip of the pillars gravitational collapse can be induced, eventually leading to
the formation of low mass stars. Detailed analysis of the evolution of the
turbulent spectra shows that UV-radiation of O-stars indeed provides an
excellent mechanism to sustain and even drive turbulence in the parental
molecular cloud."
"We develop a new fast-diffusion approximation for the kinetics of deposition
of extended objects on a linear substrate, accompanied by diffusional
relaxation. This new approximation plays the role of the mean-field theory for
such processes and is valid over a significantly larger range than an earlier
variant, which was based on a mapping to chemical reactions. In particular,
continuum-limit off-lattice deposition is described naturally within our
approximation. The criteria for the applicability of the mean-field theory are
derived. While deposition of dimers, and marginally, trimers, is affected by
fluctuations, we find that the k-mer deposition kinetics is asymptotically
mean-field like for all k=4,5,..., where the limit k->infinity, when properly
defined, describes deposition-diffusion kinetics in the continuum."
"This paper makes a comparison between x-ray absorption (XAS) and resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the rare earths. Atomic calculations are
given for 2p -> 4f and 2p -> 5d XAS. The latter calculation includes the
contraction and expansion of the 5d orbitals resulting from the complete
exchange interaction with the 4f electrons. The radiative decay of the XAS
final states is described for the situations where the core hole created in the
absorption process is filled by a valence electron or by an electron from a
shallower core level. RIXS spectra, 4f^n -> _{3d} 4f^{n+1} -> 4f^n,integrated
over the outgoing photon energy (fluorescence yield) are compared with 3d -> 4f
XAS. Sum rules related to XAS and RIXS and their applicability are discussed."
"Recent work on the complete wetting transition has emphasized the role played
by the coupling of fluctuations of the order parameter at the wall and at the
depinning fluid interface. Extending this approach to the wetting transition
itself we predict a novel crossover effect associated with the decoupling of
fluctuations as the temperature is lowered towards the transition temperature
T_W. Using this we are able to reanalyse recent Monte-Carlo simulation studies
and extract a value \omega(T_W)=0.8 at T_W=0.9T_C in very good agreement with
long standing theoretical predictions."
"The E864 experiment at BNL requires a beam counter and multiplicity detector
system that can perform at an incident beam rate of 10^7 Au ions per second. We
have developed and tested a 150 micrometer thick quartz Cherenkov beam counter
and a scintillator based multiplicity-trigger counter during the first run of
this experiment in 1994. We obtained a time resolution of 78 ps for the beam
counter at an incident beam rate 5 x 10^5 Hz and 100 ps at a rate of 1 x 10^7
Hz. Pulse height discrimination is used to obtain a minimum bias and a 10%
centrality trigger from the multiplicity detectors. The multiplicity counter
has a time resolution of 250 ps."
"A syncytium model to study some electrical properties of the eye is proposed
in the attempt to explain the phenomenon of anomalous Light Flashes (LF)
perceived by astronauts in orbit. The crystalline lens is modelled as an
ellipsoidal syncytium having a variable relative dielectric constant. The
mathematical model proposed is given by a boundary value problem for a system
of two coupled elliptic partial differential equations in two unknowns. We use
a numerical method to compute an approximate solution of this mathematical
model and we show some numerical results that provide a possible (qualitative)
explanation of the observed LF phenomenon. In particular, we calculate the
energy lost in the syncytium by a cosmic charged particle that goes through the
syncytium and compare the results with those obtained using the Geant 3.21
simulation program. We study the interaction antimatter-syncytium. We use the
Creme96 computer program to evaluate the cosmic ray fluxes encountered by the
International Space Station."
"We have searched for signatures of polarization in hadronic jets from $Z^0
\to q \bar{q}$ decays using the ``jet handedness'' method. The polar angle
asymmetry induced by the high SLC electron-beam polarization was used to
separate quark jets from antiquark jets, expected to be left- and
right-polarized, respectively. We find no evidence for jet handedness in our
global sample or in a sample of light quark jets and we set upper limits at the
95% C.L. of 0.063 and 0.099 respectively on the magnitude of the analyzing
power of the method proposed by Efremov {\it et al.}"
"Phase curve of an open loop system is flat in nature if the derivative of
phase with respect to frequency is zero. With a flat phase curve, the
corresponding closed-loop system exhibits an iso-damped property i.e. maintains
constant overshoot with the change of gain and with other parametric
variations. In recent past application, fractional order (FO) phase shapers
have been proposed by contemporary researchers to achieve enhanced parametric
robustness. In this paper, a simple Routh tabulation based methodology is
proposed to design an appropriate FO phase shaper to achieve phase flattening
in a control loop, comprising a system, controlled by a classical PID
controller. The method is demonstrated using MATLAB simulation of a second
order DC motor plant and also a first order with time delay system."
"In this paper we carry out Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a quantum
particle in a one-dimensional random potential (plus a fixed harmonic
potential) at a finite temperature. This is the simplest model of an interface
in a disordered medium and may also pertain to an electron in a dirty metal. We
compare with previous analytical results, and also derive an expression for the
sample to sample fluctuations of the mean square displacement from the origin
which is a measure of the glassiness of the system. This quantity as well as
the mean square displacement of the particle are measured in the simulation.
The similarity to the quantum spin glass in a transverse field is noted. The
effect of quantum fluctuations on the glassy behavior is discussed."
"A capturing system with multispectral filter array (MSFA) technology has been
researched to shorten the capturing time and reduce the cost. In this system,
the mosaicked image captured by the MSFA is demosaicked to reconstruct
multispectral images (MSIs). We focus on the spectral sensitivity design of a
MSFA in this paper and propose a pathology-specific MSFA. The proposed method
optimizes the MSFA by minimizing the reconstruction error between training data
of a pathological tissue and a demosaicked MSI under a cost function. Firstly,
the spectral sensitivities of the filter array are set randomly, and the
mosaicked image is obtained from the training data and the filter array. Then,
a reconstructed image is obtained by Wiener estimation. The spectral
sensitivities of the filter array are optimized iteratively by an
interior-point approach to minimize the reconstruction error. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed MSFA by comparing the recovered spectrum and RGB
image with a conventional method."
"The Galactic Center lobe is a degree-tall shell seen in radio continuum
images of the Galactic center (GC) region. If it is actually located in the GC
region, formation models would require massive energy input (e.g., starburst or
jet) to create it. At present, observations have not strongly constrained the
location or physical conditions of the GC lobe. This paper describes the
analysis of new and archival single-dish observations of radio recombination
lines toward this enigmatic object. The observations find that the ionized gas
has a morphology similar to the radio continuum emission, suggesting that they
are associated. We study averages of several transitions from H106alpha to
H191epsilon and find that the line ratios are most consistent with gas in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination line widths are remarkably
narrow, constraining the typical electron temperature to be less than about
4000 K. These observations also find evidence of pressure broadening in the
higher electronic states, implying a gas density of n_e=910^{+310}_{-450}
cm^{-3}. The electron temperature, gas pressure, and morphology are all
consistent with the idea that the GC lobe is located in the GC region. If so,
the ionized gas appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100 parsecs of
the galaxy with a mass of roughly 10^5 Msun, similar to ionized outflows seen
in dwarf starbursts."
"Capturing more information, e.g. geometry and material, using optical cameras
can greatly help the perception and understanding of complex scenes. This paper
proposes a novel method to capture the spectral and light field information
simultaneously. By using a delicately designed chromatic aberration enlarged
camera, the spectral-varying slices at different depths of the scene can be
easily captured. Afterwards, the multispectral focal stack, which is composed
of a stack of multispectral slice images focusing on different depths, can be
recovered from the spectral-varying slices by using a Local Linear
Transformation (LLT) based algorithm. The experiments verify the effectiveness
of the proposed method."
"Observations show that magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) often
do not respond to increases in gas density as would be naively expected for a
frozen-in field. This may suggest that the magnetic field in the diffuse gas
becomes detached from dense clouds as they form. We have investigated this
possibility using theoretical estimates, a simple magneto-hydrodynamic model of
a flow without mass conservation and numerical simulations of a thermally
unstable flow. Our results show that significant magnetic flux can be shed from
dense clouds as they form in the diffuse ISM, leaving behind a magnetically
dominated diffuse gas."
"Asymptotic properties of nearly-half-filled one-dimensional conductors
coupled with phonons are studied through a renormalization group method. Due to
spin-charge coupling via electron-phonon interaction, the spin correlation
varies with filling as well as the charge correlation. Depending on the
relation between cut-off energy scales of the Umklapp process and of the
electron-phonon interaction, various phases appear. We found a metallic phase
with a spin gap and a dominant charge- density-wave correlation near half
filling between a gapless density-wave phase (like in the doped repulsive
Hubbard model) and a superconductor phase with a spin gap. The spin gap is
produced by phonon-assisted backward scatterings which are interfered with the
Umklapp process constructively or destructively depending on the character of
electron-phonon coupling."
"Measurements of open charm hadro-production from CERN and Fermilab
experiments are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the absolute cross
sections and on their A and sqrt(s) dependences. Differential pt and xf cross
sections calculated with the Pythia event generator are found to be in
reasonable agreement with recent data. The calculations are scaled to
nucleus-nucleus collisions and the expected lepton pair yield is deduced. The
charm contribution to the low mass dilepton continuum observed by the CERES
experiment is found to be negligible. In particular, it is shown that the
observed low mass dilepton excess in S-Au collisions cannot be explained by
charm enhancement."
"The following two papers form a natural development of a previous series of
three articles on the foundations of quantum mechanics; they are intended to
take the theory there developed to its utmost logical and epistemological
consequences. We show in the first paper that relativistic quantum mechanics
might accommodate without ambiguities the notion of negative masses. To achieve
this, we rewrite all of its formalism for integer and half integer spin
particles and present the world revealed by this conjecture. We also base the
theory on the second order Klein-Gordon's and Dirac's equations and show that
they can be stated with only positive definite energies. In the second paper we
show that the general relativistic quantum mechanics derived in paper II of
this series supports this conjecture."
"A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary
nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical CT images with 1.25 mm slice
thickness is being developed in the framework of the INFN-supported MAGIC-5
Italian project. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system, a dot enhancement
filter for nodule candidate selection and a voxel-based neural classifier for
false-positive finding reduction, are described. Preliminary results obtained
on the so-far collected database of lung CT scans are discussed."
"In polarimetry it is important to characterize the polarization properties of
the instrument itself to disentangle real astrophysical signals from
instrumental effects. This article deals with the accurate measurement and
modeling of the polarization properties of real aluminum mirrors, as used in
astronomical telescopes. Main goals are the characterization of the aluminum
oxide layer thickness at different times after evaporation and its influence on
the polarization properties of the mirror. The full polarization properties of
an aluminum mirror are measured with Mueller matrix ellipsometry at different
incidence angles and wavelengths. The best fit of theoretical Mueller matrices
to all measurements simultaneously is obtained by taking into account a model
of bulk aluminum with a thin aluminum oxide film on top of it. Full Mueller
matrix measurements of a mirror are obtained with an absolute accuracy of ~1%
after calibration. The determined layer thicknesses indicate logarithmic growth
in the first few hours after evaporation, but it remains stable at a value of
4.12+/-0.08 nm on the long term. Although the aluminum oxide layer is
established to be thin, it is necessary to consider it to accurately describe
the mirror's polarization properties."
"A comparison is carried out between two operational wave
forecasting/assimilation models for the North Sea, with the emphasis on the
assimilation schemes. One model is the WAM model, in combination with an
optimal interpolation method (OIP). The other model, DASWAM, consists of the
third generation wave model PHIDIAS in combination with an approximate
implementation of the adjoint method.
  In an experiment over the period February 19 - March 30, 1993, the models are
driven by the same wind field (HIRLAM analysis winds), and the same observation
data set is assimilated. This set consists of a) spectra from three
pitch-and-roll buoys and b) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) spectra from the
ERS-1 satellite. Three analysis/forecast runs are performed: one without
assimilation, one with assimilation of buoy measurements only, and one with all
data assimilated. For validation, observations from four buoys, altimeter data
from ERS-1 and Topex-Poseidon, and scatterometer data from ERS-1 are used.
  A detailed analysis of the ""Wadden Storm"" (February 20-22) shows the very
different nature of the two assimilation schemes: the wave and wind field
corrections of the WAM/OIP scheme are all in the vicinity of the observations,
whereas the DASWAM adjustments are more of a global nature. The impact of some
individual buoy and SAR observations is visualized. A comparison of the
performance of the two schemes is somewhat obscured by the very different
behaviour of the two first-guess runs.
  A statistical analysis over the whole 39-day period gives the following
results. In a comparison with buoy observations it is shown that a positive
impact of wave data assimilation remains until about 12 hours in forecast in"
"A set of coordinates in the non parametric loop-space is introduced. We show
that these coordinates transform under infinite dimensional linear
representations of the diffeomorphism group. An extension of the group of loops
in terms of these objects is proposed. The enlarged group behaves locally as an
infinite dimensional Lie group. Ordinary loops form a subgroup of this group.
The algebraic properties of this new mathematical structure are analized in
detail. Applications of the formalism to field theory, quantum gravity and knot
theory are considered."
"Spectrum sensing is an important process in cognitive radio. A number of
sensing techniques that have been proposed suffer from high processing time,
hardware cost and computational complexity. To address these problems,
compressive sensing has been proposed to decrease the processing time and
expedite the scanning process of the radio spectrum. Selection of a suitable
sparse recovery algorithm is necessary to achieve this goal. A number of sparse
recovery algorithms have been proposed. This paper surveys the sparse recovery
algorithms, classify them into categories, and compares their performances. For
the comparison, we used several metrics such as recovery error, recovery time,
covariance, and phase transition diagram. The results show that techniques
under Greedy category are faster, techniques of Convex and Relaxation category
perform better in term of recovery error, and Bayesian based techniques are
observed to have an advantageous balance of small recovery error and a short
recovery time."
"Method for precise measurements of the ellipticity and rotation of the
polarization of a transverse ultrasonic wave is presented. It is applicable for
investigating the acoustic analogs of the Faraday, Cotton-Mouton, and Kerr
effects. The technique consists of measuring amplitude of the voltage on the
receiving piezoelectric transducer at a certain magnetic induction B, relative
to an initial one using three different positions of the transducer with futher
processing the data with the formulars given in the paper."
"We introduce the fuzzy supersphere as sequence of finite-dimensional,
noncommutative $Z_{2}$-graded algebras tending in a suitable limit to a dense
subalgebra of the $Z_{2}$-graded algebra of ${\cal H}^{\infty}$-functions on
the $(2| 2)$-dimensional supersphere. Noncommutative analogues of the body map
(to the (fuzzy) sphere) and the super-deRham complex are introduced. In
particular we reproduce the equality of the super-deRham cohomology of the
supersphere and the ordinary deRham cohomology of its body on the ""fuzzy
level""."
"The mechanism of DC-Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic (EFISH) generation
at weakly nonlinear buried Si(001)-SiO$_2$ interfaces is studied experimentally
in planar Si(001)-SiO$_2$-Cr MOS structures by optical second-harmonic
generation (SHG) spectroscopy with a tunable Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser. The
spectral dependence of the EFISH contribution near the direct two-photon $E_1$
transition of silicon is extracted. A systematic phenomenological model of the
EFISH phenomenon, including a detailed description of the space charge region
(SCR) at the semiconductor-dielectric interface in accumulation, depletion, and
inversion regimes, has been developed. The influence of surface quantization
effects, interface states, charge traps in the oxide layer, doping
concentration and oxide thickness on nonlocal screening of the DC-electric
field and on breaking of inversion symmetry in the SCR is considered. The model
describes EFISH generation in the SCR using a Green function formalism which
takes into account all retardation and absorption effects of the fundamental
and second harmonic (SH) waves, optical interference between field-dependent
and field-independent contributions to the SH field and multiple reflection
interference in the SiO$_2$ layer. Good agreement between the phenomenological
model and our recent and new EFISH spectroscopic results is demonstrated.
Finally, low-frequency electromodulated EFISH is demonstrated as a useful
differential spectroscopic technique for studies of the Si-SiO$_2$ interface in
silicon-based MOS structures."
"This editorial introduces the special issue of the Springer journal, Journal
of Intelligent Manufacturing, on intelligent distributed production control.
This special issue contains selected papers presented at the 13th IFAC
Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing - INCOM'2009
(Bakhtadze and Dolgui, 2009). The papers in this special issue were selected
because of their high quality and their specific way of addressing the variety
of issues dealing with intelligent distributed production control. Previous
global discussions about the state of the art in intelligent distributed
production control are provided, as well as exploratory guidelines for future
research in this area."
"We report the first experimental observation of the pionic fusion of two
heavy ions. The 12C(12C,24Mg)pi0 and 12C(12C,24Na)pi+ cross sections have been
measured to be 208 +/- 38 and 182 +/- 84 picobarns, respectively, at E_cm = 137
MeV. This cross section for heavy-ion pion production, at an energy just 6 MeV
above the absolute energy-conservation limit, constrains possible production
mechanisms to incorporate the kinetic energy of the entire projectile-target
system as well as the binding energy gained in fusion."
"The use of an automatic system for the analysis of mammographic images has
proven to be very useful to radiologists in the investigation of breast cancer,
especially in the framework of mammographic-screening programs. A breast
neoplasia is often marked by the presence of microcalcification clusters and
massive lesions in the mammogram: hence the need for tools able to recognize
such lesions at an early stage. In the framework of the GPCALMA (GRID Platform
for Computer Assisted Library for MAmmography) project, the co-working of
italian physicists and radiologists built a large distributed database of
digitized mammographic images (about 5500 images corresponding to 1650
patients) and developed a CAD (Computer Aided Detection) system, able to make
an automatic search of massive lesions and microcalcification clusters. The CAD
is implemented in the GPCALMA integrated station, which can be used also for
digitization, as archive and to perform statistical analyses. Some GPCALMA
integrated stations have already been implemented and are currently on clinical
trial in some italian hospitals. The emerging GRID technology can been used to
connect the GPCALMA integrated stations operating in different medical centers.
The GRID approach will support an effective tele- and co-working between
radiologists, cancer specialists and epidemiology experts by allowing remote
image analysis and interactive online diagnosis."
"A novel approach for structure alignment is presented, where the key
ingredients are: (1) An error function formulation of the problem
simultaneously in terms of binary (Potts) assignment variables and real-valued
atomic coordinates. (2) Minimization of the error function by an iterative
method, where in each iteration a mean field method is employed for the
assignment variables and exact rotation/translation of atomic coordinates is
performed, weighted with the corresponding assignment variables. The approach
allows for extensive search of all possible alignments, including those
involving arbitrary permutations. The algorithm is implemented using a C_alpha
representation of the backbone and explored on different protein structure
categories using the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and is successfully compared with
other algorithms. The approach performs very well with modest CPU consumption
and is robust with respect to choice of parameters. It is extremely generic and
flexible and can handle additional user-prescribed constraints easily.
Furthermore, it allows for a probabilistic interpretation of the results."
"There is a newly emerging understanding that in the chaotic domain of
isolated finite interacting many particle systems smoothed densities define the
statistical description of these systems and these densities follow from
embedded (two-body) random matrix ensembles and their various deformations.
These ensembles predict that the smoothed form of matrix elements of a
transition operator between the chaotic eigenstates weighted by the densities
at the two ends (i.e. the bivariate strength density) will be a bivariate
Gaussian with the bivariate correlation coefficient arising out of the
non-commutability of the hamiltonian and the transition operator involved. The
ensemble theory extends to systems with a mean-field and a chaos generating
two-body interaction (as in nuclei, atoms and diffusive quantum dots). These
developments in many-body quantum chaos are described with special reference to
one-body transition operators."
"We define and compute the renormalized four-momentum of the composed physical
system: classical Maxwell field interacting with charged point particles. As a
`reference' configuration for the field surrounding the particle, we take the
Born solution. Unlike in the previous approach [Gen. Relat. Grav. 26 (1994)
167; Acta Phys. Pol. A 85 (1994) 771; Commun. Math. Phys. 198 (1998), 711],
based on the Coulomb `reference', a dependence of the four-momentum of the
particle (`dressed' with the Born solution) upon its acceleration arises in a
natural way. This will change the resulting equations of motion. Similarly, we
treat the angular momentum tensor of the system."
"To analyze the crucial role of fluctuation and relaxation effects for the
function of the human brain we studied some statistical quantifiers that
support the information characteristics of neuromagnetic brain responses
(magnetoencephalogram, MEG). The signals to a flickering stimulus of different
color combinations have been obtained from a group of control subjects which is
then contrasted with those of a patient suffering photosensitive epilepsy
(PSE). We found that the existence of the specific stratification of the phase
clouds and the concomitant relaxation singularities of the corresponding
nonequilibrium dynamics of the chaotic behavior of the signals in separate
areas in a patient provide likely indicators for the zones which are
responsible for the appearance of PSE."
"The plane-wave dynamics of 3*omega => (2*omega, omega) subharmonic optical
parametric oscillators containing a second harmonic generator of the idler wave
omega is analyzed analytically by using the meanfield approximation and
numerically by taking into account the field propagation inside the media. The
resonant Chi(2):Chi(2) cascaded second-order nonlinearities induce a mutual
injection-locking of the signal and idler waves that leads to coherent self
phase-locking of the pump and subharmonic waves, freezing the phase diffusion
noise. In case of signal-and-idler resonant devices, largely detuned
sub-threshold states occur due to a subcritical bifurcation, broadening out the
self-locking frequency range to a few cavity linewidths."
"A new method for automated detection of polar coronal holes is presented.
This method, called perimeter tracing, uses a series of 171, 195, and 304 \AA\
full disk images from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO
over solar cycle 23 to measure the perimeter of polar coronal holes as they
appear on the limbs. Perimeter tracing minimizes line-of-sight obscurations
caused by the emitting plasma of the various wavelengths by taking measurements
at the solar limb. Perimeter tracing also allows for the polar rotation period
to emerge organically from the data as 33 days. We have called this the Harvey
rotation rate and count Harvey rotations starting 4 January 1900. From the
measured perimeter, we are then able to fit a curve to the data and derive an
area within the line of best fit. We observe the area of the northern polar
hole area in 1996, at the beginning of solar cycle 23, to be about 4.2% of the
total solar surface area and about 3.6% in 2007. The area of the southern polar
hole is observed to be about 4.0% in 1996 and about 3.4% in 2007. Thus, both
the north and south polar hole areas are no more than 15% smaller now than they
were at the beginning of cycle 23. This compares to the polar magnetic field
measured to be about 40% less now than it was a cycle ago."
"Glottal Closure Instants (GCI) detection consists in automatically detecting
temporal locations of most significant excitation of the vocal tract from the
speech signal. It is used in many speech analysis and processing applications,
and various algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. Recently, new
approaches using convolutional neural networks have emerged, with encouraging
results. Following this trend, we propose a simple approach that performs a
mapping from the speech waveform to a target signal from which the GCIs are
obtained by peak-picking. However, the ground truth GCIs used for training and
evaluation are usually extracted from EGG signals, which are not perfectly
reliable and often not available. To overcome this problem, we propose to train
our network on high-quality synthetic speech with perfect ground truth. The
performances of the proposed algorithm are compared with three other
state-of-the-art approaches using publicly available datasets, and the impact
of using controlled synthetic or real speech signals in the training stage is
investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
obtains similar or better results than other state-of-the-art algorithms and
that using large synthetic datasets with many speakers offers a better
generalization ability than using a smaller database of real speech and EGG
signals."
"We consider a strongly repulsive two-component Fermi gas in a one-dimensional
(1D) optical lattice described in terms of a Hubbard Hamiltonian. We analyze
the response of the system to a periodic modulation of the hopping amplitude in
presence of large two body interaction. By (essentially) exact simulations of
the time evolution, we find a non-trivial double occupancy frequency
dependence. We show how the dependence relates to the spectral features of the
system given by the Bethe ansatz. The discrete nature of the spectrum is
clearly reflected in the double occupancy after long enough modulation time. We
also discuss the implications of the 1D results to experiments in higher
dimensional systems."
"Observations of the Galactic Centre show evidence of disc-like structures of
very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within a
distance of a few 0.1 pc. While it is widely accepted that about half of the
stars form a relatively flat disc rotating clockwise on the sky, there is a
substantial ongoing debate on whether there is a second, counter-clockwise disc
of stars.
  By means of N-body simulations using our bhint code, we show that two highly
inclined stellar discs with the observed properties cannot be recognised as two
flat circular discs after 5 Myr of mutual interaction. Instead, our
calculations predict a significant warping of the two discs, which we show to
be apparent among the structures observed in the Galactic Centre. While the
high eccentricities of the observed counter-clockwise orbits suggest an
eccentric origin of this system, we show the eccentricity distribution in the
inner part of the more massive clockwise disc to be perfectly consistent with
an initially circular disc in which stellar eccentricities increase due to both
non-resonant and resonant relaxation.
  We conclude that the relevant question to ask is therefore not whether there
are two discs of young stars, but whether there were two such discs to begin
with."
"We study the evolution of the energy (mode-power) distribution for a class of
randomly perturbed Hamiltonian partial differential equations and derive {\it
master equations} for the dynamics of the expected power in the discrete modes.
In the case where the unperturbed dynamics has only discrete frequencies
(finitely or infinitely many) the mode-power distribution is governed by an
equation of discrete diffusion type for times of order $\cO(\ve^{-2})$. Here
$\ve$ denotes the size of the random perturbation. If the unperturbed system
has discrete and continuous spectrum the mode-power distribution is governed by
an equation of discrete diffusion-damping type for times of order
$\cO(\ve^{-2})$. The methods involve an extension of the authors' work on
deterministic periodic and almost periodic perturbations, and yield new results
which complement results of others, derived by probabilistic methods."
"To test the cosmic spatial isotropy, we use a rotatable torsion balance
carrying a transversely spin-polarized ferrimagnetic Dy_{6}Fe_{23} mass. With a
rotation period of one hour, the period of anisotropy signal is reduced from
one sidereal day by about 24 times, and hence the 1/f noise is greatly reduced.
Our present experimental results constrain the cosmic anisotropy Hamiltonian H
= C_{1} sigma_{1} + C_{2} sigma_{2} + C_{3} sigma_{3} (sigma_{3} is in the axis
of earth rotation) to (C_{1}^{2} +C_{2}^{2})^{1/2} = (1.8 +- 5.3) X 10^{-21} eV
and | C_{3} | = (1.2 +- 3.5) X 10^{-19} eV. This improves the previous limits
on (C_{1},C_{2}) by 120 times and C_{3} by a factor of 800."
"Properties of events originating from proton--antiproton interactions in
which the total transverse energy of the event exceeded 400 GeV are presented.
Based on a data sample of 5.45 pb-1, the topology of these hard scattering
events as well as preliminary results for the cross--section versus total
transverse energy are presented and discussed."
"Comet NEAT C/2001 Q4 was observed for linear polarization using the optical
polarimeter mounted at the 1.2m telescope at Mt. Abu Observatory, during the
months of May and June 2004. Observations were conducted through the
International Halley Watch narrow band (continuum) and B,V,R broad band
filters. During the observing run the phase angle ranged from 85.6 deg in May
to 55 deg in June. As expected, polarization increases with wavelength in this
phase angle range. Polarization colour in the narrow bands changes at different
epochs, perhaps related to cometary activity or molecular emission
contamination. The polarization was also measured in the cometary coma at
different locations along a line, in the direction of the tail. As expected, we
notice minor decrease in the polarization as photocenter (nucleus) is traversed
while brightness decreases sharply away from it. Based on these polarization
observations we infer that the comet NEAT C/2001 Q4 has high polarization and a
typical grain composition- mixture of silicates and organics."
"The thermoelectric properties of La-filled skutterudites are discussed from
the point of view of their electronic structures. These are calculated from
first principles within the local density approximation. The electronic
structure is in turn used to determine transport related quantities. Virtual
crystal calculations for La(Fe,Co)_4Sb_{12} show that the system obeys near
rigid band behavior with varying Co concentration, and has a substantial band
gap at a position corresponding to the composition LaFe_3% CoSb_{12}. The
valence band maximum occurs at the $\Gamma$ point and is due to a singly
degenerate dispersive band, which by itself would not be favorable for high
thermopower. However, very flat transition metal derived bands occur in close
proximity and become active as the doping level is increased, giving a
non-trivial dependence of the properties on carrier concentration and
explaining the favorable thermoelectric properties."
"We use absolutely calibrated data between 3 and 90 GHz from the 2006 balloon
flight of the ARCADE 2 instrument, along with previous measurements at other
frequencies, to constrain models of extragalactic emission. Such emission is a
combination of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) monopole, Galactic
foreground emission, the integrated contribution of radio emission from
external galaxies, any spectral distortions present in the CMB, and any other
extragalactic source. After removal of estimates of foreground emission from
our own Galaxy, and the estimated contribution of external galaxies, we present
fits to a combination of the flat-spectrum CMB and potential spectral
distortions in the CMB. We find 2 sigma upper limits to CMB spectral
distortions of mu < 5.8 x 10^{-5} and Y_ff < 6.2 x 10^{-5}. We also find a
significant detection of a residual signal beyond that which can be explained
by the CMB plus the integrated radio emission from galaxies estimated from
existing surveys. After subtraction of an estimate of the contribution of
discrete radio sources, this unexplained signal is consistent with
extragalactic emission in the form of a power law with amplitude 1.06 \pm 0.11
K at 1 GHz and a spectral index of -2.56 \pm 0.04."
"The critical points of the 3-states two-layer Potts model on square lattice
for different interlayer couplings (Kx, Ky,and Kz) are calculated with high
precision using probabilistic cellular automata with Glauber algorithm, where
Kx and Ky are the nearest-neighbor interactions within each layer in the x and
y directions, respectively and Kz is the interlayer coupling. The obtained
results are 0.726, 0.807, 0.928, 0.987 and 1.00 for the cases Kz per Kx = 1,
0.5, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. Then, the critical curve has been
constructed for this model."
"We review an emerging body of work by physicists addressing questions of
economic organization and function. We suggest that, beyond simply employing
models familiar from physics to economic observables, remarkable regularities
in economic data may suggest parts of social order that can usefully be
incorporated into, and in turn can broaden, the conceptual structure of
physics."
"A possible relationship between sunspot number and total annual precipitation
from the Izana Observatory has been found. The annual precipitation period
ranges from 1916 to 1998, thus including nearly eight 11-year solar cycles.
  When points of total precipitation for a given year at Izana are plotted on
the ordinate axis versus the yearly sunspot number on the abcisa axis three
years back from the precipitation one, nearly all of them lie in the lower left
hand corner of the diagram. This seems to indicate a relationship between the
above mentioned variables.
  If this relationship is confirmed it would permit the prediction of a maximum
annual precipitation at Izana three years in advance."
"We show that various actions of topological conformal theories that were
suggested recentely are particular cases of a general action. We prove the
invariance of these models under transformations generated by nilpotent
fermionic generators of arbitrary conformal dimension, $\Q$ and $\G$. The later
are shown to be the $n^{th}$ covariant derivative with respect to ``flat
abelian gauge field"" of the fermionic fields of those models. We derive the
bosonic counterparts $\W$ and $\R$ which together with $\Q$ and $\G$ form a
special $N=2$ super $W_\infty$ algebra. The algebraic structure is discussed
and it is shown that it generalizes the so called ``topological algebra""."
"We propose a receding horizon control strategy that readily handles systems
that exhibit interval-wise total energy constraints on the input control
sequence. The approach is based on a variable optimization horizon length and
contractive final state constraint sets. The optimization horizon, which
recedes by N steps every N steps, is the key to accommodate the interval-wise
total energy constraints. The varying optimization horizon along with the
contractive constraints are used to achieve analytic asymptotic stability of
the system under the proposed scheme. The strategy is demonstrated by
simulation examples."
"Special relativity is reformulated as a symmetry property of space-time:
Space-Time Exchange Invariance. The additional hypothesis of spatial
homogeneity is then sufficient to derive the Lorentz transformation without
reference to the traditional form of the Principle of Special Relativity. The
kinematical version of the latter is shown to be a consequence of the Lorentz
transformation. As a dynamical application, the laws of electrodynamics and
magnetodynamics are derived from those of electrostatics and magnetostatics
respectively. The 4-vector nature of the electromagnetic potential plays a
crucial role in the last two derivations."
"We introduce a general class of models for charaterizing the non-Gaussian
properties of foreground contaminants in the cosmic microwave background with
view towards the removal of the non-primordial non-Gaussian signal from the
primordial one. This is important not only for treating temperature maps but
also for characterizing the nature and origin of the primordial cosmological
perturbations and thus establishing a theory of the early universe."
"A reliable spectral analysis requires sampling rate at least twice as large
as the frequency bound, otherwise the analysis will be unreliable and plagued
with aliasing distortions. The RR samplings do not satisfy the above
requirements and therefore their spectral analysis might be unreliable.
  In order to demonstrate the feasibility of aliasing in RR spectral analysis,
we have done an experiment which have shown clearly how the aliasing was
developed. In the experiments, one of us (A.G) had kept his high breathing rate
constant with the aid of metronome for more than 5 minutes. The breathing rate
was larger than one-half the heart rate. Very accurate results were obtained
and the resulting aliasing well understood. To our best knowledge this is the
first controlled experiment of this kind coducted on humans.
  We compared the RR spectral analysis with the spectrum of the ECG signals
from which the RR intervals were extracted. In the significant for RR analysis
frequencies (below one-half Hertz) significant differences were observed.
  In conclusion we recommend to study the spectral analysis of the ECG signal
in the free of aliasing frequency range."
"We investigate a novel stochastic technique for the global optimization of
complex potential energy surfaces (PES) that avoids the freezing problem of
simulated annealing by allowing the dynamical process to tunnel energetically
inaccessible regions of the PES by way of a dynamically adjusted nonlinear
transformation of the original PES. We demonstrate the success of this
approach, which is characterized by a single adjustable parameter, for three
generic hard minimization problems."
"We analyze the dynamical evolution of systems which obey simple growth laws,
like diffusion limited aggregation or dielectric breakdown. We show that, if
the developing patterns is sufficiently complex, a scale invariant noise
spectrum is generated, in agreement with the hypothesis that the system is in a
self organized critical state. The intrinsic noise generated in the evolution
is shown to be independent of the (extrinsic) stochastic aspects of the growth.
Instead, it is related to the complexity of the generated pattern."
"The crucial role that Ions Energy Distribution Function (IEDF) at the
electrodes plays in plasma processing of semiconductor materials demands that
this quantity be predicted with high accuracy and with low noise levels in any
plasma simulator. In this work, an efficient Particle-in-cell/Monte-Carlo
(PIC/MC) simulator is developed to model IEDF at the electrodes of
electronegative plasma discharges. The simulator uses an effective method to
increase the number of MC particles in regions of low particle density by
splitting the particles and by adjusting their statistical weight. This
statistical enhancement technique, which does not require interprocessor
communication, is particularly suitable for parallel processing. The simulator
is used to model an electronegative rf discharge at a pressure of 25 mTorr. The
IEDF obtained from this simulator has good statistics with low noise levels,
whereas the IEDF calculated by standard PIC/MC simulator is jammed with
stochastic noise."
"The Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) is a multi-object conjugate prior
for the closed-form Bayes random finite sets filter. The extended object PMBM
filter provides a closed-form solution for multiple extended object filtering
with standard models. This paper considers computationally lighter alternatives
to the extended object PMBM filter by propagating a Poisson multi-Bernoulli
(PMB) density through the filtering recursion. A new local hypothesis
representation is presented where each measurement creates a new Bernoulli
component. This facilitates the developments of methods for efficiently
approximating the PMBM posterior density after the update step as a PMB. Based
on the new hypothesis representation, two approximation methods are presented:
one is based on the track-oriented multi-Bernoulli (MB) approximation, and the
other is based on the variational MB approximation via Kullback-Leibler
divergence minimisation. The performance of the proposed PMB filters with gamma
Gaussian inverse-Wishart implementations are evaluated in a simulation study."
"A large-scale molecular dynamics simulation is performed on a glass-forming
Lennard-Jones mixture to determine the nature of dynamical heterogeneities
which arise in this model fragile liquid. We observe that the most mobile
particles exhibit a cooperative motion in the form of string-like paths
(``strings'') whose mean length and radius of gyration increase as the liquid
is cooled. The length distribution of the strings is found to be similar to
that expected for the equilibrium polymerization of linear polymer chains."
"A precision measurement of the cosmic-ray positron spectrum may help to solve
the puzzle of the nature of dark matter. Pairwise annihilation of neutralinos,
predicted by some supersymmetric extensions to the standard model of particle
physics, may leave a distinct feature in the cosmic-ray positron spectrum.
  As the available data are limited both in terms of statistics and energy
range, we are developing a balloon-borne detector (PEBS) with a large
acceptance of 4000 cm^2 sr. A superconducting magnet creating a field of 0.8 T
and a tracking device consisting of scintillating fibers of 0.25 mm diameter
with silicon photomultiplier readout will allow rigidity and charge
determination to energies above 100 GeV. The dominant proton background is
suppressed by the combination of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a
transition radiation detector consisting of fleece layers interspersed with
straw-tube proportional counters. The calorimeter uses a sandwich of tungsten
and scintillating fibers that are again read out by silicon photomultipliers."
"The conceptual background for a detailed study of the urban form of the city
of Bologna is discussed with a view to modern methodological insight as it is
being presented by recent results of complexity theory and the theory of
self-organized criticality. The basic idea is to visualize the city of Bologna
as an example of a massively parallely organized and interacting complex
computational system in the sense of these recent theories. It is proposed to
relate aspects of urban evolution to a universal concept of evolution which is
governing all processes in nature. The universality of this approach is thought
of as being an epistemological advantage as compared to more classical studies
utilizing primarily local and specific methods for their modelling procedures.
To actually establish whether this is in fact an advantage or not will be one
of the main results of this present series of papers. In this very first part
of the study, the basic idea is explicated in some detail, and the fundamental
concepts are introduced in order to clarify the terminology utilized in the
following. Two more parts of this study will follow in due time."
"We present new interferometric data obtained with MIDI (MID infrared
Interferometric instrument) for the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, with an
extensive coverage of sixteen uv points. These observations resolve the nuclear
mid-infrared emission from NGC 1068 in unprecedented detail with a maximum
resolution of 7 mas. For the first time, sufficient uv points have been
obtained, allowing us to generate an image of the source using maximum entropy
image reconstruction. The features of the image are similar to those obtained
by modelling. We find that the mid-infrared emission can be represented by two
components, each with a Gaussian brightness distribution. The first, identified
as the inner funnel of the obscuring torus, is hot (800K), 1.35 parsec long,
and 0.45 parsec thick in FWHM at a PA=-42 degrees (from north to east). It has
an absorption profile different than standard interstellar dust and with
evidence for clumpiness. The second component is 3 by 4 pc in FWHM with T=300K,
and we identify it with the cooler body of the torus. The compact component is
tilted by 45 degrees with respect to the radio jet and has similar size and
orientation to the observed water maser distribution. We show how the dust
distribution relates to other observables within a few parsecs of the core of
the galaxy such as the nuclear masers, the radio jet, and the ionization cone.
We compare our findings to a similar study of the Circinus galaxy and other
relevant studies. Our findings shed new light on the relation between the
different parsec-scale components in NGC 1068 and the obscuring torus."
"It is shown that the total energy of the static ""field + particle"" system,
defined in the framework of classical, renormalized electrodynamics of
particles and fields, depends in an unstable way upon the field boundary data.
It is argued that this phenomenon may be also an origin of the unstable
dynamical behaviour of the system (i.e. existence of ""runaway solutions""). It
is proved that a suitable polarization mechanism of the particle restores the
stability, at least on the level of statics. Whether or not it restores also
the full, dynamical stability of the theory is still an open question."
"We examine the applicability of the continuum model to describe the surface
morphology of a hetero-growth system: compositionally-graded, relaxed GeSi
films on (001) Si substrates. Surface roughness versus lateral dimension was
analyzed for samples what were grown under different conditions. We find that
all samples belong to the same growth class, in which the surface roughness
scales linearly with lateral size at small scales and appears to saturate at
large scales. For length scales ranging from 1 nm to 100 $\mu$m, the scaling
behavior can be described by a linear continuum model consisting of a surface
diffusion term and a Laplacian term. However, in-depth analysis on
non-universal amplitudes indicates the breaking of up-down symmetry, suggesting
the presence of non-linear terms in the microscopic model. We argue that the
leading non-linear term has the form of $\lambda _1(\nabla h)^2$, but its
effect on scaling exponents will not be evident for length scales less than 1
mm. Therefore, the growth dynamics of this system is described by the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, consisting of the two linear terms plus $\lambda
_1(\nabla h)^2$, driven by a Gaussian noise. We also discuss the negative
coefficient in the Laplacian term as an instability mechanism responsible for
large scale film morphology on the final surface."
"The propagation of an electromagnetic pulse in a plasma is studied for pulse
durations that are comparable to the plasma period. When the carrier frequency
of the incident pulse is much higher than the plasma frequency, the pulse
propagates without distortion at its group speed. When the carrier frequency is
comparable to the plasma frequency, the pulse is distorted and leaves behind it
an electromagnetic wake."
"A $2D$ model describing depinning of an interface from a rough, self-affine
substrate, is studied by transfer matrix methods. The phase diagram is
determined for several values of the roughness exponent, $\zeta_S$, of the
attractive wall. For all $\zeta_S>0$ the following scenario is observed. In
first place, in contrast to the case of a flat wall ($\zeta_S=0$), for wall
attraction energies between zero and a $\zeta_S$-dependent positive value, the
substrate is always wet. Furthermore, in a small range of attraction energies,
a dewetting transition first occurs as T increases, followed by a wetting one.
This unusual reentrance phenomenon seems to be a peculiar feature of
self-affine roughness, and does not occur, e. g., for periodically corrugated
substrates."
"Models that provide insight into how extreme positions regarding any social
phenomenon may spread in a society or at the global scale are of great current
interest. A realistic model must account for the fact that globalization and
internet have given rise to scale-free networks of interactions between people.
We propose a novel model which takes into account the nature of the
interactions network, and provides some key insights into this phenomenon,
including: (1) There is a fundamental difference between a hierarchical network
whereby people are influenced by those that are higher on the hierarchy but not
by those below them, and a symmetrical network where person-on-person influence
works mutually. (2) A few ""fanatics"" can influence a large fraction of the
population either temporarily (in the hierarchical networks) or permanently (in
symmetrical networks). Even if the ""fanatics"" disappear, the population may
still remain susceptible to the positions advocated by them. The model is,
however, general and applicable to any phenomenon for which there is a degree
of enthusiasm or susceptibility to in the population."
"Using a cross-correlation method, we study the X-ray halo of Cyg X-3. Two
components of dust distributions are needed to explain the time lags derived by
the cross-correlation method. Assuming the distance as 1.7 kpc for Cygnus OB2
association (a richest OB association in the local Galaxy) and another uniform
dust distribution, we get a distance of $7.2^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$ kpc (68$%$
confidence level) for Cyg X-3. When using the distance estimation of Cygnus OB2
as 1.38 kpc or 1.82 kpc, the inferred distance for Cyg X-3 is
$3.4^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ kpc or $9.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ kpc respectively. The distance
estimation uncertainty of Cyg X-3 is mainly related to the distance of the
Cygnus OB2, which may be improved in the future with high precision astrometric
measurements. The advantage of this method is that the result depends weakly on
the photon energy, dust grain radius, scattering cross-section and so on."
"We study low-speed flows of a highly compressible, single-phase fluid in the
presence of gravity, for example in a regime appropriate for modeling recent
space-shuttle experiments on fluids near the liquid-vapor critical point. In
the equations of motion, we include forces due to capillary stresses that arise
from a contribution made by strong density gradients to the free energy. We
derive formally simplified sets of equations in a low-speed limit analogous to
the zero Mach number limit in combustion theory.
  When viscosity is neglected and gravity is weak, the simplified system
includes: a hyperbolic equation for velocity, a parabolic equation for
temperature, an elliptic equation related to volume expansion, an
integro-differential equation for mean pressure, and an algebraic equation (the
equation of state). Solutions are determined by initial values for the mean
pressure, the temperature field, and the divergence-free part of the velocity
field. To model multidimensional flows with strong gravity, we offer an
alternative to the anelastic approximation, one which admits stratified fluids
in thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as gravity waves but not acoustic waves."
"Photosystem 0 concerns a primitive mechanism for free energy gain as ATP from
fluctuating light during early evolution. The PS0 reaction centers had no
reducing power: charge transport was only temporary. Light induced within the
reaction centers metastable dipoles that generated a membrane potential. This
in turn drove ATP synthesis by protons moving through the ATP synthase enzyme.
After the decay of the dipole potential in the dark, the protons either (1)
returned across the membrane by conduction or (2) were pumped back by ATP
synthase, backwards active as ATPase at a higher H+/ATP ratio. PS0 constitutes
a link to previously proposed free energy sources for early evolution that
worked on thermal cycling. Several contemporary photosynthetic phenomena may be
relics of PS0."
"The behaviour of the chiral condensate in QCD is investigated by means of a
study of the distribution of the zeros of the partition function in the complex
quark mass plane. Simulations are performed at fixed temperature on three
different spatial volumes at $\beta=5.04$ and at $\beta=4.9$ and $\beta=5.2$ on
a $4^4$ lattice. Evidence is found for a chirally related transition at
non-zero quark mass in the intermediate coupling region for $\beta < 5.2 $ but
superimposed upon a smooth behaviour for the condensate. The critical mass at
which this transition is found is only weakly dependent on the spatial volume
and decreas with decreasing temperature."
"We use ab initio static relaxation methods and semi-empirical
molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate the energetics and dynamics of
the diffusion of adatoms, dimers, and vacancies on Cu(100). It is found that
the dynamical energy barriers for diffusion are well approximated by the
static, 0 K barriers and that prefactors do not depend sensitively on the
species undergoing diffusion. The ab initio barriers are observed to be
significantly lower when calculated within the generalized-gradient
approximation (GGA) rather than in the local-density approximation (LDA). Our
calculations predict that surface diffusion should proceed primarily via the
diffusion of vacancies. Adatoms are found to migrate most easily via a jump
mechanism. This is the case, also, of dimers, even though the corresponding
barrier is slightly larger than it is for adatoms. We observe, further, that
dimers diffuse more readily than they can dissociate. Our results are discussed
in the context of recent submonolayer growth experiments of Cu(100)."
"We explore the quantum dynamics of photoassociation of Bose-Einstein
condensed atoms into molecules using an optical cavity field. Inside of an
optical resonator, photoassociation of quantum degenerate atoms involves the
interaction of three coupled quantum fields for the atoms, molecules, and the
photons. The feedback created by a high-Q optical cavity causes the cavity
field to become a dynamical quantity whose behavior is linked in a nonlinear
manner to the atoms inside and where vacuum fluctuations have a more important
role than in free space. We develop and compare several methods for calculating
the dynamics of the atom-molecule conversion process with a coherently driven
cavity field. We first introduce an alternate operator representation for the
Hamiltonian from which we derive an improved form of mean field theory and an
approximate solution of the Heisenberg-Langevin (HL) equations that properly
accounts for quantum noise in the cavity field. It is shown that our improved
mean field theory corrects several deficiencies in traditional mean field
theory based on expectation values of annihilation/creation operators. Also, we
show by direct comparison to numerical solutions of the density matrix
equations that our approximate quantum solution of HL equations gives an
accurate description of weakly or undriven cavities where mean field theories
break down."
"In the theory of optical gap solitons, slowly-moving finite-amplitude
Lorentzian solutions are found to mediate the transition from bright to
coexistent dark-antidark solitary wave pairs when the laser frequency is
detuned out of the proper edge of a dynamical photonic bandgap. Catastrophe
theory is applied to give a geometrical description of this strongly
asymmetrical 'morphing' process."
"Nonlinear plane acoustic waves propagating through a fluid are studied using
Burgers' equation with finite viscosity. The evolution of a simple N-pulse with
regular and random initial amplitude and of pulses with monochromatic and noise
carrier is considered. In the latter case the initial pulses are characterized
by two length scales. The length scale of the modulation function is much
greater than the period or the length scale of the carrier. With increasing
time the initial pulses are deformed and shocks appear. The finite viscosity
leads to a finite shock width, which does not depend on the fine structure of
the initial pulse and is fully determined by the shock position in the zero
viscosity limit. The other effect of nonzero viscosity is the shift of the
shock position from the position at zero viscosity. This shift, as well as the
linear time, at which the nonlinear stage of evolution changes to the linear
stage, depends on the fine structure of the initial pulse. It is also shown
that the nonlinearity of the medium leads to generation of a nonzero mean field
from an initial random field with zero mean value. The relative fluctuation of
the field is investigated both at the nonlinear and the linear stage."
"The spectra of $A_r$ affine Toda field theories with imaginary coupling
constant, are investigated. Soliton solutions are found, which, despite the
non-unitary form of the Lagrangian, have real classical masses and are stable
to small perturbations. The quantum corrections to the soliton masses are
determined, to lowest order in $\hbar$. The solitons have the same spectrum as
the fundamental Toda particles; a feature that is preserved in the quantum
theory."
"We show how the concept of quantum open system and the methods in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics can be usefully applied to studies of
quantum statistical processes in the early universe. We first sketch how noise,
fluctuation, dissipation and decoherence processes arise in a wide range of
cosmological problems. We then focus on the origin and nature of noise in
quantum fields and spacetime dynamics. We introduce the concept of
geometrodynamic noise and suggest a statistical mechanical definition of
gravitational entropy. We end with a brief discussion of the theoretical
appropriateness to view the physical universe as an open system."
"We discuss the angular resolution obtained for events registered with the
surface detector alone and for hybrid events, i.e., those observed
simultaneously by both the surface and fluorescence detectors. The angular
accuracy of the surface detector is directly extracted from the data itself and
on an event by event basis, and is given as a function of the number of
stations triggered by the event and of the zenith angle of the shower. We
compare the angular resolution of the surface detector obtained from hybrid
events with the one obtained from the surface detector alone."
"Floquet theory is used to describe the unstable spectrum at large scales of
the beta-plane equation linearized about Rossby waves. Base flows consisting of
one to three Rossby wave are considered analytically using continued fractions
and the method of multiple scales, while base flow with more than three Rossby
waves are studied numerically. It is demonstrated that the mechanism for
instability changes from inflectional to triad resonance at an O(1) transition
Rhines number Rh, independent of the Reynolds number. For a single Rossby wave
base flow, the critical Reynolds number Re^c for instability is found in
various limits. In the limits Rh --> infinity and k --> 0, the classical value
Re^c = sqrt(2) is recovered. For Rh --> 0 and all orientations of the Rossby
wave except zonal and meridional, the base flow is unstable for all Reynolds
numbers; a zonal Rossby wave is stable, while a meridional Rossby wave has
critical Reynolds number Re^c = sqrt(2). For more isotropic base flows
consisting of many Rossby waves (up to forty), the most unstable mode is purely
zonal for 2 <= Rh < infinity and is nearly zonal for Rh = 1/2, where the
transition Rhines number is again O(1), independent of the Reynolds number and
consistent with a change in the mechanism for instability from inflectional to
triad resonance."
"Rotor-routing is a procedure for routing tokens through a network that can
implement certain kinds of computation. These computations are inherently
asynchronous (the order in which tokens are routed makes no difference) and
distributed (information is spread throughout the system). It is also possible
to efficiently check that a computation has been carried out correctly in less
time than the computation itself required, provided one has a certificate that
can itself be computed by the rotor-router network. Rotor-router networks can
be viewed as both discrete analogues of continuous linear systems and
deterministic analogues of stochastic processes."
"We study the infrared behaviour of the two-dimensional Euclidean O(N)
nonlinear sigma-Model with a suitable ultraviolet cutoff. It is proven that for
a sufficiently large (but finite!) number N of field components the model is
massive and thus has exponentially decaying correlation functions. We use a
representation of the model with an interpolating bosonic field. This permits
to analyse the infrared behaviour without any intermediate breaking of
O(N)-symmetry. The proof is simpler than that of the corresponding result for
the Gross-Neveu-Model."
"For instruments with many occasional users, it is important to have easy to
use software. To support the frequent users it is important to be flexible.
Using a scripting language to design a GUI and exposing it to the user allows
us to do both. We present our work on a GUI for reflectometry data analysis and
reduction written in Tcl/Tk and Octave, with underlying C code for the
numerically intensive portions. As well as being easier to train new users, the
new software allows existing users to do in minutes what used to take hours."
"The magnetospheric emissions from extrasolar planets represent a science
frontier for the next decade. All of the solar system giant planets and the
Earth produce radio emissions as a result of interactions between their
magnetic fields and the solar wind. In the case of the Earth, its magnetic
field may contribute to its habitability by protecting its atmosphere from
solar wind erosion and by preventing energetic particles from reaching its
surface. Indirect evidence for at least some extrasolar giant planets also
having magnetic fields includes the modulation of emission lines of their host
stars phased with the planetary orbits, likely due to interactions between the
stellar and planetary magnetic fields. If magnetic fields are a generic
property of giant planets, then extrasolar giant planets should emit at radio
wavelengths allowing for their direct detection. Existing observations place
limits comparable to the flux densities expected from the strongest emissions.
Additional sensitivity at low radio frequencies coupled with algorithmic
improvements likely will enable a new means of detection and characterization
of extrasolar planets within the next decade."
"While humanity has not yet observed any extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI),
contact with ETI remains possible. Contact could occur through a broad range of
scenarios that have varying consequences for humanity. However, many
discussions of this question assume that contact will follow a particular
scenario that derives from the hopes and fears of the author. In this paper, we
analyze a broad range of contact scenarios in terms of whether contact with ETI
would benefit or harm humanity. This type of broad analysis can help us prepare
for actual contact with ETI even if the details of contact do not fully
resemble any specific scenario."
"The Van Hove singularity (VHS) provides a paradigm for the study of the role
of peaks in the density of states (dos) on electronic properties. More
importantly, it appears to play a major role in the physics of the high-T_c
superconductors, particularly since recent photoemission studies have found
that the VHS is close to the Fermi level in most of the high-T_c cuprates near
the composition of optimum T_c. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the
VHS model, describing both theoretical properties and experimental evidence for
the picture. Special topics discussed include a survey of the Fermi surfaces of
the cuprates and related compounds, and an analysis of the reliability of the
slave boson approach to correlation effects.
  While many properties of the cuprates can be qualitatively understood by a
simple rigid-band-filling model, this is inadequate for more quantitative
results, since correlation effects tend to pin the Fermi level near the VHS
over an extended doping range, and can lead to a nanoscale phase separation.
Furthermore, the peaks in the dos lead to competition from other instabilities,
both magnetic and structural (related to charge density waves). A novel form of
dynamic structural instability, involving dynamic VHS-Jahn-Teller effects has
been predicted. Scattered through the literature, there is considerable
experimental evidence for both nanoscale phase separation of holes, and for
local, possibly dynamic, structural disorder. This review attempts to gather
these results into a comprehensive database, to sort the results, and to see
how they fit into the Van Hove scenario. Recent experiments on underdoped
cuprates are found to provide a strong confirmation that the pseudogap is
driven by a splitting of the VHS degeneracy."
"Based on the assumption that the target space duality ($T\to 1/T$) is
preserved even nonperturbatively, the properties of static string vacua are
studied. A discussion of the effective four-dimensional supergravity action
based on target-space modular symmetry $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ is presented. The
nonperturbative superpotential removes the vacuum degeneracy with respect to
the compactification modulus ($T$) generically breaks supersymmetry with
negative cosmological constant. Charged matter fields get negative $(mass)^2$
signalling an additional instability of string vacuum and the blowing up of
orbifold singularities. In addition for a class of modularly invariant
potentials topologically stable stringy domain walls of nontrivial compaction
modulus field configuration are found. They are supersymmetric solutions, thus
saturating the Bogomolnyi bound. Their physical implications are discussed."
"Magnetic moment measurements in odd nuclei directly probe the distribution of
fermion states and hence provide one of the most critical tests for multi-$j$
supersymmetries in collective nuclei. Due to complexity of calculations and
lack of data, such tests have not been performed in the past. Using the
Mathematica software, we derive analytic expressions for magnetic moments in
the $SO^{(BF)}(6) \times SU^{(F)}(2)$ limit of the $U(6/12)$ supersymmetry and
compare the results with recent measurements in $^{195}$Pt."
"Track and field world records have risen and fallen throughout the history of
the sport. A recent rash of record-breaking performances has prompted the
question: ""How good can we get?"". This article offers a review of several
attempts to answer this question, based on mathematical modeling of key
physiological processes. The predictions are compared with present-day world
records, and a discussion of the future of athletics ensues..."
"We summarize and compare recent Molecular Dynamics simulations on the
interactions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers in the liquid
crystalline phase with a number of small molecules including trehalose, a
disaccharide of glucose, alcohols, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The sugar
molecules tend to stabilize the structure of the bilayer as they bridge
adjacent lipid headgroups. They do not strongly change the structure of the
bilayer. Alcohols and DMSO destabilize the bilayer as they increase its area
per molecule in the bilayer plane and decrease the order parameter. Alcohols
have a stronger detrimental effect than DMSO. The observables which we compare
are the area per molecule in the plane of the bilayer, the membrane thickness,
and the NMR order parameter of DPPC hydrocarbon tails. The area per molecule
and the order parameter are very well correlated whereas the bilayer thickness
is not necessarily correlated with them."
"Transitions between ``glassy'' local minima of a model free-energy functional
for a dense hard-sphere system are studied numerically using a
``microcanonical'' Monte Carlo method that enables us to obtain the transition
probability as a function of the free energy and the Monte Carlo ``time''. The
growth of the height of the effective free energy barrier with density is found
to be consistent with a Vogel-Fulcher law. The dependence of the transition
probability on time indicates that this growth is primarily due to entropic
effects arising from the difficulty of finding low-free-energy saddle points
connecting glassy minima."
"Some of the well-known experiments: the ''muon'' experiment, the
Michelson-Morley type experiments, the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments and
the Ives-Stilwell type experiments are analyzed using the nonrelativistic
theory, the ''apparent transformations (AT) relativity'' and the ''true
transformations (TT) relativity.'' It is shown that all the experiments (when
they are complete from the ''TT relativity'' viewpoint) are in agreement with
the ''TT relativity'' in which the special relativity is understood as the
theory of a four-dimensional spacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry. It
is also explicitly shown that, in contrast to the usual opinion, the commonly
used ''AT relativity'' does not always agree with experiments. The concept of
sameness of a physical quantity is essential for the distinction between the
two forms of relativity both in the theory and in experiments. The difference
in this concept causes the agreement of the ''TT relativity'' with the
experiments and the disagreement of the ''AT relativity.''"
"The experimental emission probabilities of complex fragments by low energy
compound nuclei and their dependence upon energy and atomic number are compared
to the transition state rates. Intermediate-mass-fragment multiplicity
distributions for a variety of reactions at intermediate energies are shown to
be binomial and thus reducible at all measured transverse energies. From these
distributions a single binary event probability can be extracted which has a
thermal dependence. A strong thermal signature is also found in the charge
distributions. The n-fold charge distributions are reducible to the 1-fold
charge distributions through a simple scaling dictated by fold number and
charge conservation."
"We consider the effect of spatial correlations on sources of polarized
electromagnetic radiation. The sources, assumed to be monochromatic, are
constructed out of dipoles aligned along a line such that their orientation is
correlated with their position. In one representative example, the dipole
orientations are prescribed by a generalized form of the standard von Mises
distribution for angular variables such that the azimuthal angle of dipoles is
correlated with their position. In another example the tip of the dipole vector
traces a helix around the symmetry axis of the source, thereby modelling the
DNA molecule. We study the polarization properties of the radiation emitted
from such sources in the radiation zone. For certain ranges of the parameters
we find a rather striking angular dependence of polarization. This may find
useful applications in certain biological systems as well as in astrophysical
sources."
"The quantum electrodynamic theory of the nuclear recoil effect in atoms to
all orders in \alpha Z is formulated. The nuclear recoil corrections for atoms
with one and two electrons over closed shells are considered in detail. The
problem of the composite nuclear structure in the theory of the nuclear recoil
effect is discussed."
"Thermal ions in spherical tokamaks have two adiabatic invariants: the
magnetic moment and the longitudinal invariant. For hot ions, variations in
magnetic-field strength over a gyro period can become sufficiently large to
cause breakdown of the adiabatic invariance. The magnetic moment is more
sensitive to perturbations than the longitudinal invariant and there exists an
intermediate regime, super-adiabaticity, where the longitudinal invariant
remains adiabatic, but the magnetic moment does not. The motion of
super-adiabatic ions remains integrable and confinement is thus preserved.
However, above a threshold energy, the longitudinal invariant becomes
non-adiabatic too, and confinement is lost as the motion becomes chaotic. We
predict beam ions in present-day spherical tokamaks to be super-adiabatic but
fusion alphas in proposed burning-plasma spherical tokamaks to be
non-adiabatic."
"Field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion are
applied to a model of a passive scalar field, advected by the Gaussian strongly
anisotropic velocity field. Inertial-range anomalous scaling behavior is
established, and explicit asymptotic expressions for the n-th order structure
functions of scalar field are obtained; they are represented by superpositions
of power laws with nonuniversal (dependent on the anisotropy parameters)
anomalous exponents. In the limit of vanishing anisotropy, the exponents are
associated with tensor composite operators built of the scalar gradients, and
exhibit a kind of hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy: the less is
the rank, the less is the dimension and, consequently, the more important is
the contribution to the inertial-range behavior. The leading terms of the even
(odd) structure functions are given by the scalar (vector) operators. For the
finite anisotropy, the exponents cannot be associated with individual operators
(which are essentially ``mixed'' in renormalization), but the aforementioned
hierarchy survives for all the cases studied. The second-order structure
function is studied in more detail using the renormalization group and
zero-mode techniques."
"In the near future there will be launched space missions (e.g. COROT,
KEPLER), designed to detect Earth-like extrasolar planets. The orbital elements
of these (still hypothetic) planets will contain some uncertainties, that can
only be eliminated by careful dynamical investigations of the hosting planetary
systems. The proportion of extrasolar planetary systems with one known giant
planet is high ($\sim 90 %$), therefore as a first step we have investigated
the possible existence of terrestrial planets in these systems. In this paper a
development of a stability catalogue of the habitable zones of exoplanetary
systems is reported. This catalogue is formed by a series of stability maps,
which can help to establish, where Earth-like planets could exist in extrasolar
planetary systems having one giant planet. After a description of the dynamical
model and the numerical methods, details of the stability maps are discussed.
An application of the stability catalogue to 15 known exoplanetary systems is
also shown, and a characterization of the stability properties of their
habitable zones is given."
"Two principal scenarios of magnetization reversal are considered. In the
first scenario all spins perform coherent motion and an excess of magnetic
energy directly goes to a nonmagnetic thermal bath. A general dynamic equation
is derived which includes a tensor damping term similar to the
Bloch-Bloembergen form but the magnetization magnitude remains constant for any
deviation from equilibrium. In the second reversal scenario, the absolute value
of the averaged sample magnetization is decreased by a rapid excitation of
nonlinear spin-wave resonances by uniform magnetization precession. We have
developed an analytic k-space micromagnetic approach that describes this entire
reversal process in an ultra-thin soft ferromagnetic film for up to 90^{o}
deviation from equilibrium. Conditions for the occurrence of the two scenarios
are discussed."
"Numerical and physical experiments on two-dimensional (2d) turbulence show
that the differences of transverse components of velocity field are well
described by a gaussian statistics and Kolmogorov scaling exponents. In this
case the dissipation fluctuations are irrelevant in the limit of small
viscosity. In general, one can assume existence of critical
space-dimensionality $d=d_{c}$, at which the energy flux and all odd-order
moments of velocity difference change sign and the dissipation fluctuations
become dynamically unimportant. At $d<d_{c}$ the flow can be described by the
``mean-field theory'', leading to the observed gaussian statistics and
Kolmogorov scaling of transverse velocity differences. It is shown that in the
vicinity of $d=d_{c}$ the ratio of the relaxation and translation
characteristic times decreases to zero, thus giving rise to a small parameter
of the theory. The expressions for pressure and dissipation contributions to
the exact equation for the generating function of transverse velocity
differences are derived in the vicinity of $d=d_{c}$. The resulting equation
describes experimental data on two-dimensional turbulence and demonstrate onset
of intermittency as $d-d_{c}>0$ and $r/L\to 0$ in three-dimensional flows in
close agreement with experimental data. In addition, some new exact relations
between correlation functions of velocity differences are derived. It is also
predicted that the single-point pdf of transverse velocity difference in
developing as well as in the large-scale stabilized two-dimensional turbulence
is a gaussian."
"In this paper, we study the effects of instrumental systematics on the
reconstruction of the deflection angle power spectrum from weak lensing of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations. We
consider seven types of effects which are related to known instrumental
systematics: calibration, rotation, pointing, spin-flip, monopole leakage,
dipole leakage and quadrupole leakage. These effects can be characterized by 11
distortion fields. Each of these systematic effects can mimic the effective
projected matter power spectrum and hence contaminate the lensing
reconstruction. To demonstrate the effect of these instrumental systematics, we
consider two types of experiments, one with a detector noise level for
polarization of 9.6 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 8.0', typical of upcoming ground and
balloon-based CMB experiments, and a CMBPol-like instrument with a detector
noise level for polarization of 2.0 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 4.0', typical of
future space-based CMB experiments. For each systematics, we consider various
choices of coherence scale. Among all the 11 systematic parameters, rotation
and monopole leakage place the most stringent requirements, while quadrupole
leakage, pointing error, and calibration are among the least demanding. The
requirements from lensing extraction are about 1-2 orders of magnitude less
stringent than the requirements to measure the primordial B-modes with
inflationary energy scale of 1.0*10^{16} GeV. On the other hand the
requirements for lensing reconstruction are comparable or even more stringent
for some systematic parameters than the requirements to detect primordial
B-modes with inflationary scale E_i = 3.0*10^{16} GeV."
"The core of scientific research is turning new ideas into reality. From the
school science fair to the search for the secrets of dark energy, high-quality
research consists of scientific investigation constrained within the scope of a
well-defined project. Large or small, generously funded or just scraping
by,scientific projects use time, money, and information to turn ideas into
plans, plans into action, and action into results. While we, as a community, do
much to educate students in the techniques of research, we do not
systematically train students in the nature and organization of scientific
projects or in the techniques of project management. We propose a two-pronged
attack to address this issue in the next decade. First, to generate a broad
base of future scientists who have a basic familiarity with the ideas of
projects, we propose that the community develop standards for the content of a
project design and management course in astronomy and astrophysics. Second, to
train future scientists to assume leadership roles in new investigations in
astronomy and astrophysics, we propose that the community develop standards for
graduate programs in the area of research project leadership."
"The discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) is a flexible technique for computing
scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary geometry. In this paper we
perform systematic study of various non-stationary iterative (conjugate
gradient) methods in search for the most efficient one in order to solve the
system of equations arising in DDA. We document implementation of these methods
in our public domain code DDSCAT.5a"
"Employing the Lanczos algorithm in combination with a kernel polynomial
moment expansion (KPM) and the maximum entropy method (MEM), we show a way of
calculating charge and spin excitations in the Holstein t-J model, including
the full quantum nature of phonons. To analyze polaron band formation we
evaluate the hole spectral function for a wide range of electron-phonon
coupling strengths. For the first time, we present results for the optical
conductivity of the 2D Holstein t-J model."
"We present a list of interstellar absorption lines in the direction of HD
37061 in the M 43 nebula. Some of the absorption lines arise from atomic
excited levels that are uncommon in interstellar clouds. The excited levels of
Fe II are populated by fluorescence. We found a large number of H2 molecular
absorption lines arising from vibrationally excited levels. The ortho/para H2
ratio is equal to 2.7. The H2 rotational temperature of vibrational levels 1 -
5 exceeds 2000 K."
"We show that it is possible to generalize the Ursell-Mayer cluster formalism
so that it may cover also the statistics of Internet websites. Our starting
point is the introduction of an extra variable that is assumed to take account,
as will be explained, of the nature of the Internet statistics. We then show,
following the arguments in Mayer, that one may obtain a phase transition-like
phenomena"
"We exploit the recent observations of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the
Galactic halo and investigate the constraints on the IMF of the stellar
population that left these low-mass survivors of [Fe/H]<-2.5 and the chemical
evolution that they took part in. A high-mass IMF with the typical mass~10Msun
and the overwhelming contribution of low-mass members of binaries to the EMP
survivors are derived from the statistics of carbon-enriched EMP stars with and
without the enhancement of s-process elements (Komiya et al. 2007). We first
examine the analysis to confirm their results for various assumptions on the
mass-ratio distribution function. As compared with the uniform distribution,
the increase or decrease function of the mass ratio gives a higher- or
lower-mass IMF, and a lower-mass IMF results for the independent distribution
with the both members in the same IMF, but the derived ranges of typical mass
differ less than by a factor of two and overlap for the extreme cases.
Furthermore, we prove that the same constraints are placed on the IMF from the
surface density of EMP stars estimated from the surveys and the chemical
evolution consistent with the metal yields of theoretical supernova models. We
then apply the derived high-mass IMF with the binary contribution to show that
the observed MDF of EMP stars can be reproduced not only for the shape but also
for the number of EMP stars. In particular, the scarcity of stars below
[Fe/H]<-4 is naturally explained in terms of the hierarchical structure
formation, and there is no indication of significant changes in the IMF for the
EMP Population. The present study indicates that 3 HMP stars of [Fe/H]<-4 are
the primordial stars that were born as the low-mass members of binaries before
the host clouds were polluted by their own supernovae."
"We present a direct measurement of the density profile of a two-dimensional
Mott Insulator formed by ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. High resolution
absorption imaging is used to probe the ""wedding-cake"" structure of a trapped
gas as it crosses the boundary from a unit-filled Mott insulating phase to the
superfluid phase at finite temperature. Detailed analysis of images yields
measurements of temperature and local compressibility; for the latter we
observe a strong suppression deep in the Mott-insulating phase, which is
recovered for the superfluid and normal phases. Furthermore, we measure
spatially resolved fluctuations in the local density, showing a suppression of
fluctuations in the insulator. Results are consistent with the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem for insulator, superfluid and normal gas."
"We elaborate on a previous attempt to prove the irreversibility of the
renormalization group flow above two dimensions. This involves the construction
of a monotonically decreasing $c$-function using a spectral representation. The
missing step of the proof is a good definition of this function at the fixed
points. We argue that for all kinds of perturbative flows the $c$-function is
well-defined and the $c$-theorem holds in any dimension. We provide examples in
multicritical and multicomponent scalar theories for dimension $2<d<4$. We also
discuss the non-perturbative flows in the yet unsettled case of the $O(N)$
sigma-model for $2\leq d\leq 4$ and large $N$."
"Improved branching ratios were measured for the $K_L \to 3 \pi^0 $ decay in a
neutral beam at the CERN SPS with the NA31 detector: $\Gamma (K_L \to 3 \pi^0)
/ \Gamma (K_L \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0) = 1.611 \pm 0.037$ and $\Gamma (K_L \to 3
\pi^0) / \Gamma (K_L \to \pi e \nu ) = 0.545 \pm 0.010$.
  From the first number an upper limit for $\Delta I =5/2$ and $\Delta I = 7/2
$ transitions in neutral kaon decay is derived. Using older results for the
Ke3/K$\mu $3 fraction, the 3$\pi^0$ branching ratio is found to be $\Gamma (K_L
\to 3 \pi^0 )/ \Gamma_{tot} = (0.211 \pm 0.003)$, about a factor three more
precise than from previous experiments."
"[Abridged] We calculate the structural evolution and nucleosynthesis of a
grid of models covering the metallicity range: -6.5 < [Fe/H] < -3.0 (plus Z=0),
and mass range: 0.85 < M < 3.0 Msun, amounting to 20 stars in total. In this
paper, the first of a series describing and analysing this large data set, we
present the resulting stellar yields. Many of the models experience violent
nuclear burning episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these
events as `Dual Flashes'. These events have also been reported by previous
studies. Some of the material processed by the Dual Flashes is dredged up
causing significant surface pollution with a distinct chemical composition. We
also analyse the yields in terms of C and N, comparing them to the observed
CEMP abundances. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] < -4.0) we find the yields
to contain ~1 to 2 dex too much carbon, in agreement with all previous studies.
At higher metallicities ([Fe/H] = -3.0), where the observed data set is much
larger, all our models produce yields with [C/Fe] values consistent with those
observed in the most C-rich CEMPs. However it is only the low-mass models that
undergo the Dual Shell Flash (which occurs at the start of the TPAGB) that can
best reproduce the C and N observations. Normal Third Dredge-Up can not
reproduce the observations because at these metallicities intermediate mass
models (M > 2 Msun) suffer HBB which converts the C to N thus lowering [C/N]
well below the observations, whilst if TDU were to occur in the low-mass (M < 1
Msun) models (we do not find it to occur in our models), the yields would be
expected to be C-rich only, which is at odds with the `dual pollution' of C and
N generally observed in the CEMPs."
"The scientific field of traffic engineering encompasses a rich set of
mathematical techniques, as well as researchers with entirely different
backgrounds. This paper provides an overview of what is currently the
state-of-the-art with respect to traffic flow theory. Starting with a brief
history, we introduce the microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of
vehicular traffic flows. Moving on, we review some performance indicators that
allow us to assess the quality of traffic operations. A final part of this
paper discusses some of the relations between traffic flow characteristics,
i.e., the fundamental diagrams, and sheds some light on the different points of
view adopted by the traffic engineering community."
"The properties of a partially ionized plasma in a long cylindrical tube
subject to a uniform axial electric field are investigated. The plasma is
maintained by an external ionizing source balanced by bulk and surface
recombinations. Collisions between neutrals, whose density greatly exceeds the
density of charged particles, and of neutrals with ions are sufficiently
effective for their velocity distribution to be close to a Maxwellian with the
same uniform temperature, independent of the external field. The behavior of
the plasma is described by a collisional two-fluid scheme with charge
neutrality in the interior of the tube. Approximate nonlinear equations for the
hydrodynamical moments are obtained from a Boltzmann equation in which
electron-neutral, electron-ion and electron-electron collisions are all
important. It is found that under certain circumstances the current, and the
temperature of the electrons undergo a drastic change, with hysteresis, as the
electric field is varied."
"Atomic diffusion is usually understood as a succession of random, independent
displacements of an adatom over the surface's potential energy landscape.
Nevertheless, an analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations of self-diffusion
on Cu(111) demonstrates the existence of different types of correlations in the
atomic jumps at all temperatures. Thus, the atomic displacements cannot be
correctly described in terms of a random walk model. This fact has a profound
impact on the determination and interpretation of diffusion coefficients."
"We report results of 3D MHD simulations of the dynamics of buoyant bubbles in
magnetized galaxy cluster media. The simulations are three dimensional
extensions of two dimensional calculations reported by Jones & De Young (2005).
Initially spherical bubbles and briefly inflated spherical bubbles all with
radii a few times smaller than the intracluster medium (ICM) scale height were
followed as they rose through several ICM scale heights. Such bubbles quickly
evolve into a toroidal form that, in the absence of magnetic influences, is
stable against fragmentation in our simulations. This ring formation results
from (commonly used) initial conditions that cause ICM material below the
bubbles to drive upwards through the bubble, creating a vortex ring; that is,
hydrostatic bubbles develop into ""smoke rings"", if they are initially not very
much smaller or very much larger than the ICM scale height. Even modest ICM
magnetic fields with beta = P_gas/P_mag ~ 10^3 can influence the dynamics of
the bubbles, provided the fields are not tangled on scales comparable to or
smaller than the size of the bubbles. Quasi-uniform, horizontal fields with
initial beta ~ 10^2 bifurcated our bubbles before they rose more than about a
scale height of the ICM, and substantially weaker fields produced clear
distortions. On the other hand, tangled magnetic fields with similar, modest
strengths are generally less easily amplified by the bubble motions and are
thus less influential in bubble evolution. Inclusion of a comparably strong,
tangled magnetic field inside the initial bubbles had little effect on our
bubble evolution, since those fields were quickly diminished through expansion
of the bubble and reconnection of the initial field."
"Sir Joseph LARMOR showed in 1897 that an oscillating electric charge emits
radiation energy proportional to (acceleration)$^2$. At first sight,the result
appears to be valid for arbitrary accelerations. But, perpetual uniform
acceleration has been a case of nagging doubts, as radiation reaction vanishes
and the equivalence principle, as also conformal symmetry of Maxwell equations
each require nil energy loss. Special hypotheses are devised by some to justify
the assumption of radiation loss for both perpetual and non-perpetual (uniform)
accelerations which, as in the case of (uniform) velocities, are really
different. The problem is here simply resolved by an explicit computation to
show absence of radiation for the perpetual case and by illustrating that
Larmor formula makes sense {\it only if} there is {\it change} in acceleration,
just as kinetic energy has nontrivial quantitative sense, only when there is
change in velocity."
"A model that describes self diffusion, island nucleation and film growth on
FCC(001) metal substrates is presented. The parameters of the model are
optimized to describe Cu diffusion on Cu(001), by comparing activation energy
barriers to a full set of barriers obtained from semi-empirical potentials via
the embedded atom method. It is found that this model (model I), with only
three parameters, provides a very good description of the full landscape of
hopping energy barriers. These energy barriers are grouped in four main peaks.
A reduced model (model II) with only two parameters, is also presented, in
which each peak is collapsed into a single energy value. From the results of
our simulations, we find that this model still maintains the essential features
of diffusion and growth on this model surface. We find that hopping rates along
island edges are much higher than for isolated atoms (giving rise to compact
island shapes) and that vacancy mobility is higher than adatom mobility. We
observe substantial dimer mobility (comparable to the single atom mobility) as
well as some mobility of trimers. Mobility of small islands affects the scaling
of island density $N$ vs. deposition rate $F$, $N ~ F^\gamma$, as well as the
island size distribution. In the asymptotic limit of slow deposition, scaling
arguments and rate equations show that $\gamma = i*/(2 i* + 1)$ where $i*$ is
the size of the largest mobile island. Our Monte Carlo results, obtained for a
range of experimentally relevant conditions, show $\gamma = 0.32$ for the EAM,
0.33 for model I and 0.31 for model II barriers. These results are lower than
the anticipated $\gamma >= 0.4$ due to dimer (and trimer) mobility."
"The Lie symmetries of a large class of generalized Toda field theories are
studied and used to perform symmetry reduction. Reductions lead to generalized
Toda lattices on one hand, to periodic systems on the other. Boundary
conditions are introduced to reduce theories on an infinite lattice to those on
semi-infinite, or finite ones."
"We investigate the equilibrium geometries and the systematics of bonding in
various isomers of a 24-atom boron cluster using Born-Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics within the framework of density functional theory. The isomers studied
are the rings, the convex and the quasiplanar structures, the tubes and, the
closed structures. A staggered double-ring is found to be the most stable
structure amongst the isomers studied. Our calculations reveal that a 24-atom
boron cluster does form closed 3-d structures. All isomers show staggered
arrangement of nearest neighbor atoms. Such a staggering facilitates $sp^2$
hybridization in boron cluster. A polarization of bonds between the peripheral
atoms in the ring and the planar isomers is also seen. Finally, we discuss the
fusion of two boron icosahedra. We find that the fusion occurs when the
distance between the two icosahedra is less than a critical distance of about
6.5a.u."
"We demonstrate how to construct dynamic phase diagrams for complex fluids
that undergo transitions under flow, in which the conserved composition
variable and the broken-symmetry order parameter (nematic, smectic,
crystalline, etc.) are coupled to shear rate. Our construction relies on a
selection criterion, the existence of a steady interface connecting two stable
homogeneous states. We use the (generalized) Doi model of lyotropic nematic
liquid crystals as a model system, but the method can be easily applied to
other systems, provided non-local effects are included."
"The atomic force microscope is a versatile tool that allows many routes to be
used for investigating the mechanical properties of soft materials on the
nanometer scale. In the present work, experiments were performed on polystyrene
polymer films of various molecular weight by approaching a vibrating nanotip
towards the surface. The variation of the oscillating amplitude of the
cantilever is interpreted as the result of the growth process of a
nanoprotuberance. The growth rate is found to be dependent of the magnitude of
the oscillating amplitude and of the molecular weight. A model is developed
describing in a very simple way the action of the tip and a viscoelastic
response of the polymer. The numerical simulation helps in understanding the
nonlinear relation between the growth rate and the vibrating amplitude of the
microlever and describes qualitatively most of the experimental features. For
the softer material, experimental situations are found that allow the
experimental results to be amenable with an analytical solution. The analytical
solution provides a fruitful comparison with the experimental results showing
that some of the nanoprotuberance evolution cannot be explained with the
approximation used. The presents results show that there exists a new and
fascinating route to better understand the mechanical response at the local
scale."
"We analyze 21 aftershock sequences of California to test for evidence of
space-time diffusion. Aftershock diffusion may result from stress diffusion and
is also predicted by any mechanism of stress weakening. Here, we test an
alternative mechanism to explain aftershock diffusion, based on multiple
cascades of triggering. In order to characterize aftershock diffusion, we
develop two methods, one based on a suitable time and space windowing, the
other using a wavelet transform adapted to the removal of background
seismicity. Both methods confirm that diffusion of seismic activity is very
weak, much weaker than reported in previous studies. A possible mechanism
explaining the weakness of observed diffusion is the effect of geometry,
including the localization of aftershocks on a fractal fault network and the
impact of extended rupture lengths which control the typical distances of
interaction between earthquakes."
"A model of cellular metabolism due to S. Kauffman is analyzed. It consists of
a network of Boolean gates randomly assembled according to a probability
distribution. It is shown that the behavior of the network depends very
critically on certain simple algebraic parameters of the distribution. In some
cases, the analytic results support conclusions based on simulations of random
Boolean networks, but in other cases, they do not."
"We propose new construction of dependent variables for equations of an ideal
barotropic fluid. This construction is based on a direct generalization of the
known connection between Schroedinger equation and a system of Euler-type
equations. The system for two complex-valued functions is derived that is
equivalent to Euler equations. Possible advantages of the proposed formulation
are discussed."
"We investigate the sample of 213 GPS sources selected from simultaneous
multi-frequency 1-22 GHz observations obtained with RATAN-600 radio telescope.
We use publicly available data to characterize parsec-scale structure of the
selected sources. Among them we found 121 core dominated sources, 76 Compact
Symmetric Object (CSO) candidates (24 of them are highly probable), 16 sources
have complex parsec-scale morphology. Most of GPS galaxies are characterized by
CSO-type morphology and lower observed peak frequency (~1.8 GHz). Most of GPS
quasars are characterized by ""core-jet""-type morphology and higher observed
peak frequency (~3.6 GHz). This is in good agreement with previous results.
However, we found a number of sources for which the general relation CSO -
galaxy, core-jet - quasar does not hold. These sources deserve detailed
investigation. Assuming simple synchrotron model of a homogeneous cloud we
estimate characteristic magnetic field in parsec-scale components of GPS
sources to be B ~ 10 mG."
"Transport through a one-dimensional wire of interacting electrons connected
to semi infinite leads is investigated using a bosonization approach. The
dynamic nonlocal conductivity is rigorously expressed in terms of the
transmission. For abrupt variations of the interaction parameters at the
junctions, an incident electron is transmitted as a sequence of partial
charges: the central wire acts as a Fabry-P\'erot resonator. The dc conductance
is shown to be given by the total transmission which turns out to be perfect.
When the wire has a tendency towards superconducting order, partial Andreev
reflection of an incident electron occurs. Finally, we study the role of a weak
barrier at one contact or inside the wire by a renormalization group method at
finite temperature. We compute the conductance in the presence of localized or
extended disorder, and compare our results to recent experiments on quantum
wires."
"We consider the influence of an external periodic potential on the fractional
quantum Hall effect of two-dimensional interacting electron systems. For many
electrons on a torus, we find that the splitting of incompressible ground state
degeneracies by a weak external potential diminishes as $\exp ( - L/ \xi)$ at
large system size $L$. We present numerical results consistent with a scenario
in which $\xi$ diverges at continuous phase transitions from fractional to
integer quantum Hall states which occur with increasing external potential
strength."
"The performance of 16 and 64 channel photomultipliers coupled to
scintillating fibres has been tested. The devices are sensitive to single
photoelectrons, show little gain losses for magnetic fields up to 100 Gauss and
have moderate optical cross-talk. The maximum channel to channel gain
variations reach a factor two for the 16 channel version and a factor of four
for the 64 channel PM. The measurements and simulations indicate that the
photomultipliers are well suited for the light detection in fibre trackers."
"We give a stochastic extension of the Brane Calculus, along the lines of
recent work by Cardelli and Mardare. In this presentation, the semantics of a
Brane process is a measure of the stochastic distribution of possible
derivations. To this end, we first introduce a labelled transition system for
Brane Calculus, proving its adequacy w.r.t. the usual reduction semantics.
Then, brane systems are presented as Markov processes over the measurable space
generated by terms up-to syntactic congruence, and where the measures are
indexed by the actions of this new LTS. Finally, we provide a SOS presentation
of this stochastic semantics, which is compositional and syntax-driven."
"A simulation of de-biased population of NEAs is presented. The numerical
integration of modeled orbits reveals geometrical conditions of close
approaching NEAs to the Earth. The population with the absolute magnitude up to
H=28 is simulated during one year. The probability of possible discoveries of
the objects in the Earth vicinity is discussed."
"We discuss the problem of broken time reversal symmetry near grain boundaries
in a d-wave superconductor based on a Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is shown that
such a state can lead to fractional vortices on the grain boundary. Both
analytical and numerical results show the structure of this type of state."
"It has been shown that given a classical background in string theory which is
independent of $d$ of the space-time coordinates, we can generate other
classical backgrounds by $O(d)\otimes O(d)$ transformation on the solution. We
study the effect of this transformation on the known black $p$-brane solutions
in string theory, and show how these transformations produce new classical
solutions labelled by extra continuous parameters and containing background
antisymmetric tensor field."
"The study of the evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation has been
controversial in the past years. The main difficulty is in determining the
required parameters for intermediate and high redshift galaxies.
  This work aims to identify the main problems of the study of the Tully-Fisher
relation at high redshift using optical emission lines, in order to draw
conclusions about the possible evolution of this relation in the B, R, and
I-bands.
  With this aim, the rotational velocities obtained from the widths of
different optical lines using DEEP2 spectra are compared. Morphology has been
determined via HST images, using and comparing different methodologies.
Instrumental magnitudes are then corrected for K and extinction and the
absolute magnitudes derived for the concordance cosmological model. Finally,
the optical Tully-Fisher relations in B, R, and I-bands at different redshifts
up to z = 1.3 are derived.
  Although most studies (this one included) find evidence of evolution, the
results are not conclusive enough, since the possible luminosity evolution is
within the scattering of the relation, and the evolution in slope is difficult
to determine because at high redshift only the brightest galaxies can be
measured. Nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same for
all bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies were
brighter in the past for the same rotation velocity. This result also implies
that the colour of the Tully-Fisher relation does not change with redshift,
supporting the collapse model versus the accretion model of disc galaxy
formation."
"This paper presents a cross-lingual voice conversion framework that adopts a
modularized neural network. The modularized neural network has a common input
structure that is shared for both languages, and two separate output modules,
one for each language. The idea is motivated by the fact that phonetic systems
of languages are similar because humans share a common vocal production system,
but acoustic renderings, such as prosody and phonotactic, vary a lot from
language to language. The modularized neural network is trained to map Phonetic
PosteriorGram (PPG) to acoustic features for multiple speakers. It is
conditioned on a speaker i-vector to generate the desired target voice. We
validated the idea between English and Mandarin languages in objective and
subjective tests. In addition, mixed-lingual PPG derived from a unified
English-Mandarin acoustic model is proposed to capture the linguistic
information from both languages. It is found that our proposed modularized
neural network significantly outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of
speech quality and speaker individuality, and mixed-lingual PPG representation
further improves the conversion performance."
"We investigate the behavior of a threshold model for the spreading of fads
and similar phenomena in society. The model is giving the fad dynamics and is
intended to be confined to an underlying network structure. We investigate the
whole parameter space of the fad dynamics on three types of network models. The
dynamics we discover is rich and highly dependent on the underlying network
structure. For some range of the parameter space, for all types of substrate
networks, there are a great variety of sizes and life-lengths of the fads --
what one see in real-world social and economical systems."
"The interplay between the band Jahn-Teller distortion and the
superconductivity is studied for the system whose Fermi level lies in two-fold
degenerate band. Assuming that the lattice distortion is coupled to the orbital
electron density and the superconductivity arises due to BCS pairing mechanism
between the electrons, the phase diagram is obtained for different doping with
respect to half-filled band situation. The coexistence phase of
superconductivity and distortion occurs within limited range of doping and the
distortion lowers the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. In presence
of strong electron-lattice interaction the lattice strain is found to be
maximum at half-filling and superconductivity does not appear for low doping.
The maximum value of $T_c$ obtainable for an optimum doping is limited by the
structural transition temperature $T_s$. The growth of distortion is arrested
with the onset of superconductivity and the distortion is found to disappear at
lower temperature for some hole density. Such arresting of the growth of
distortion at $T_c$ produces discontinuous jump in thermal expansion
coefficient. The variation of strain with temperature as well as with doping,
thermal expansion coefficient, the $T_c$ vs $\delta$ behaviour are in
qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations on interplay of
distortion and superconductivity in cuprates."
"Measuring Quality of Experience (QoE) and integrating these measurements into
video streaming algorithms is a multi-faceted problem that fundamentally
requires the design of comprehensive subjective QoE databases and metrics. To
achieve this goal, we have recently designed the LIVE-NFLX-II database, a
highly-realistic database which contains subjective QoE responses to various
design dimensions, such as bitrate adaptation algorithms, network conditions
and video content. Our database builds on recent advancements in
content-adaptive encoding and incorporates actual network traces to capture
realistic network variations on the client device. Using our database, we study
the effects of multiple streaming dimensions on user experience and evaluate
video quality and quality of experience models. We believe that the tools
introduced here will help inspire further progress on the development of
perceptually-optimized client adaptation and video streaming strategies. The
database is publicly available at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/LIVE_NFLX_II/live_nflx_plus.html."
"We present a low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of the
Au(111) and of the Cu(111) surface states showing that their binding energy
increases when the tip is approached towards the surface. This result,
supported by a one-dimensional model calculation and by a comparison to
existing photoemission spectroscopy measurements, confirms the existence of a
tip-induced Stark effect as previously reported for Ag(111) [L. Limot et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 196801 (2003)], and suggests that this effect is a general
feature of scanning tunneling spectroscopy."
"A Bayesian re-analysis of published radial velocity data sets is providing
evidence for additional planetary candidates. The nonlinear model fitting is
accomplished with a new hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which
incorporates parallel tempering, simulated annealing and genetic crossover
operations. Each of these features facilitate the detection of a global minimum
in chi^2. By combining all three, the HMCMC greatly increases the probability
of realizing this goal. When applied to the Kepler problem it acts as a
powerful multi-planet Kepler periodogram for both parameter estimation and
model selection. The HMCMC algorithm is embedded in a unique two stage adaptive
control system that automates the tuning of the MCMC proposal distributions
through an annealing operation."
"Bayesian inference --- although becoming popular in physics and chemistry ---
is hampered up to now by the vagueness of its notion of prior probability. Some
of its supporters argue that this vagueness is the unavoidable consequence of
the subjectivity of judgements --- even scientific ones. We argue that priors
can be defined uniquely if the statistical model at hand possesses a symmetry
and if the ensuing confidence intervals are subjected to a frequentist
criterion. Moreover, it is shown via an example taken from recent experimental
nuclear physics, that this procedure can be extended to models with broken
symmetry."
"In this paper, the phase diagrams of a polar spin-1 Bose gas in a
three-dimensional optical lattice with linear and quadratic Zeeman effects both
at zero and finite temperatures are obtained within mean-field theory. The
phase diagrams can be regrouped to two different parameter regimes depending on
the magnitude of the quadratic Zeeman effect $Q$. For large $Q$, only a
first-order phase transition from the nematic (NM) phase to the fully magnetic
(FM) phase is found, while in the case of small $Q$, a first-order phase
transition from the nematic phase to the partially magnetic (PM) phase, plus a
second-order phase transition from the PM phase to the FM phase is obtained. If
a net magnetization in the system exists, the first-order phase transition
causes a coexistence of two phases and phase separation: for large $Q$, NM and
FM phases and for small $Q$, NM and PM phases. The phase diagrams in terms of
net magnetization are also obtained."
"We give a strong evidence that noncrystalline materials such as quasicrystals
or incommensurate solids are not exceptions but rather are generic in some
regions of a phase space. We show this by constructing classical lattice-gas
models with translation-invariant, finite-range interactions and with a unique
quasiperiodic ground state which is stable against small perturbations of
two-body potentials. More generally, we provide a criterion for stability of
nonperiodic ground states."
"A simple model that describes traffic flow in two dimensions is studied. A
sharp {\it jamming transition } is found that separates between the low density
dynamical phase in which all cars move at maximal speed and the high density
jammed phase in which they are all stuck. Self organization effects in both
phases are studied and discussed."
"Several authors have employed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for stress and
strain analysis in orthopaedic biomechanics. Unfortunately, the use of
three-dimensional models is time consuming and consequently the number of
analysis to be performed is limited. The authors have investigated a new method
allowing automatically 3D mesh generation for structures as complex as bone for
example. This method called Mesh-Matching (M-M) algorithm generated
automatically customized 3D meshes of bones from an already existing model. The
M-M algorithm has been used to generate FE models of ten proximal human femora
from an initial one which had been experimentally validated. The new meshes
seemed to demonstrate satisfying results."
"A prescription is presented for real-time finite-temperature perturbation
theory in covariant gauges, in which only the two physical degrees of freedom
of the gauge-field propagator acquire thermal parts. The propagators for the
unphysical degrees of freedom of the gauge field, and for the Faddeev-Popov
ghost field, are independent of temperature. This prescription is applied to
the calculation of the one-loop gluon self-energy and the two-loop interaction
pressure, and is found to be simpler to use than the conventional one."
"Quasiparticles of the fractional quantum Hall systems obey fractional
(including mutual) exclusion statistics. In this note we study the effects of
exclusion statistics on thermal activation of quasiparticle pairs in the
approximation of generalized ideal gas. The distribution function for thermally
activated quasiparticles is found explicitly for the statistics matrix given by
the composite fermion picture and the thermodynamic consequences are discussed
analytically. In particular, at low temperatures, there is a
quasielectron-quasihole duality in the description of the system between two
adjacent magic fillings $\nu(m,p)\equiv m/(2pm+1)$ and $\nu(m+1,p)$."
"Magnetically trapped neutral atoms can be cooled with the evaporation
technique. This is typically done by using a radiofrequency (rf) field that
adiabatically couples trapped and untrapped internal atomic states for atoms
with kinetic energies above a value set by the field frequency. The rf-field
can also induce nonadiabatic changes of internal atomic spin states (F,M) that
lead to heating and enhanced loss of atoms. In this paper we use wave packet
simulations to show that the evaporation process can induce these nonadiabatic
transitions which change the internal spin state of doubly spin-polarized (2,2)
trapped atoms. We also verify the validity of a multistate Landau-Zener model
in describing the nonadiabatic dynamics. In addition, we calculate exchange
relaxation rate coefficients for collisions between atoms in the (2,M) states
of 23-Na atoms. Large exchange relaxation coefficients for 23-Na as compared to
87-Rb F=2 suggest that evaporative cooling of (2,2) Na will be more difficult
than for the corresponding state of Rb."
"We present a reliable, narrow linewidth (100 kHz) continuous-wave optical
parametric oscillator (OPO) suitable for high-resolution spectroscopy
applications. The OPO is based on a periodically-poled lithium-niobate crystal
and features a specially designed intracavity etalon which permits its
continuous tuning and stable operation at any desired wavelength in a wide
operation range. We demonstrate Doppler-free spectroscopy on a rovibrational
transition of methane at 3.39 um."
"Many hydrodynamic instability patterns can be put into correspondence with a
subset of characteristic surfaces of tangential discontinuities. These
topological limits sets to systems of hyperbolic PDE's are locally unstable,
but a certain subset associated with minimal surfaces are globally stabilized,
persistent and non-dissipative. Sections of these surfaces are the spiral
scrolls so often observed in hydrodynamic wakes. This method of wake production
does not depend explicitly upon viscosity."
"We investigate a two-dimensional network simulator capable of modeling
different time dependencies in two-phase drainage displacements. In particular,
we focus on the temporal evolution of the pressure due to capillary and viscous
forces and the time dependence of the interface between the two liquids. The
dynamics of the capillary effect are taken into account and we report on high
accuracy pressure measurements. Moreover, the simulator includes important
features in drainage, like burst dynamics of the invading fluid and
simultaneous flow of two liquids in a section of a tube. The validity of the
model is checked by comparing simulation results with well known experimental
properties in drainage displacement."
"To date the onset of large-scale star formation in galaxies and its link to
gravitational stability of the galactic disk have not been fully understood.
The nearby face-on spiral galaxy M51 is an ideal target for studying this
subject. This paper combines CO, dust, HI, and stellar maps of M51 and its
companion galaxy to study the H2/HI transition, the gas-to-dust ratios, and the
stability of the disk against gravitational collapse. We combine maps of the
molecular gas using 12CO 2--1 map HERA/IRAM-30m data and HI VLA data to study
the total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to molecular
gas. The total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from
850 micron SCUBA data. Taking into account the velocity dispersions of the
molecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the
2MASS K-band survey, we derive the total Toomre Q parameter of the disk. The
gas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared to
that of the interarm regions. The ratio of molecular to atomic surface density
shows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure P_hydro. The
gas surface density distribution in M51 shows an underlying exponential
distribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the total
gas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. In
contrast to the velocity widths observed in HI, the CO velocity dispersion
shows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions.
The contribution of the stellar component in the Toomre Q-parameter analysis is
significant and lowers the combined Q-parameter Q_tot by up to 70% towards the
threshold for gravitational instability. The value of Q_tot varies from 1.5-3
in radial averages. A map of Q_tot shows values around 1 on the spiral arms."
"We propose a minimal nonlinear model of brittle crack propagation by
considering only the motion of the crack-tip atom. The model captures many
essential features of steady-state crack velocity and is in excellent
quantitative agreement with many-body dynamical simulations. The model exhibits
lattice-trapping. For loads just above this, the crack velocity rises sharply,
reaching a limiting value well below that predicted by elastic continuum
theory. We trace the origin of the low limiting velocity to the anharmonicity
of the potential well experienced by the crack-tip atom."
"In this paper we present some concepts in heavy ion atomic physics for the
extraction of parity violating effects. We investigate the effects of the
so-called Stark-quenching, i.e., the fast decay of a meta stable state induced
by a Stark field, and the superposition of one- and two-photon transitions in
beryllium-like heavy ions. It turns out that the discussed theoretical
phenomena for heavy ions with few electrons are beyond the scope of present day
experimental possibilities because one has to require beam energies of up to 1
TeV/A, laser intensities of up to $10^{17} {\rm W/cm^2}$ and ion currents of up
to $10^{11}$ ions per second in beryllium-like uranium. However, especially the
superposition of one- and two-photon transitions is a very interesting
phenomenon that could provide the germ of an idea to be applied in a more
favorable system."
"The variances of the fluid-particle acceleration and of the pressure-gradient
and viscous force are given. The scaling parameters for these variances are
velocity statistics measureable with a single-wire anemometer. For both high
and low Reynolds numbers, asymptotic scaling formulas are given; these agree
quantitatively with DNS data. Thus, the scaling can be presumed known for all
Reynolds numbers. Fluid-particle acceleration variance does not obey K41
scaling at any Reynolds number; this is consistent with recent experimental
data. The non-dimensional pressure-gradient variance named lambda-sub{T}
/lambda-sub{P} is shown to be obsolete."
"It seems now accepted that speech noise in open plan offices is the main
source of discomfort for employees. This work follows a series of studies
conducted at INRS France and INSA Lyon based on Hongisto's theoretical model
(2005) linking the Decrease in Performance (DP) and the Speech Transmission
Index (STI). This model predicts that for STI values between 0.7 and 1, which
means a speech signal close to 100% of intelligibility, the DP remains constant
at about 7%. The experiment that we carried out aimed to gather more
information about the relation between DP and STI, varying the STI value up to
0.9. Fifty-five subjects between 25-59 years old participated in the
experiment. First, some psychological parameters were observed in order to
better characterize the inter-subjects variability. Then, subjects performed a
Working-Memory (WM) task in silence and in four different sound conditions (STI
from 0.25 to 0.9). This task was customized by an initial measure of mnemonic
span so that two different cognitive loads (low/high) were equally defined for
each subject around their span value. Subjects also subjectively evaluated
their mental load and discomfort at the end of each WM task, for each noise
condition. Results show a significant effect of the STI on the DP, the mental
load and the discomfort. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found
between the age of subjects and their performance during the WM task. This
result was confirmed by a cluster analysis that enabled us to separate the
subjects on two different groups, one group of younger and more efficient
subjects and one group of older and less efficient subjects. General results
did not show any increase of DP for the highest STI values, so the ""plateau""
hypothesis of Hongisto's model cannot be rejected on the basis of this
experiment."
"In this article we give an introduction to the Fock quantization of the
Maxwell field. At the classical level, we treat the theory in both the
covariant and canonical phase space formalisms. The approach is general since
we consider arbitrary (globally-hyperbolic) space-times. The Fock quantization
is shown to be equivalent to the definition of a complex structure on the
classical phase space. As examples, we consider stationary space-times as well
as ordinary Minkowski space-time. The account is pedagogical in spirit and is
tailored to beginning graduate students. The paper is selfcontained and is
intended to fill an existing gap in the literature."
"The Groth field is one of the sky regions that will be targeted by the OTELO
(OSIRIS Tunable Filter Emission Line Object) survey in the optical 820 nm and
920 nm atmospheric windows. This field has been observed by AEGIS
(All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey) covering the full
spectral range, from X-rays to radio waves. Chandra X-ray data with total
exposure time of 200ksec are analyzed and combined with optical broadband data
of the Groth field in order to study a set of structural parameters of the
X-ray emitters and its relation with X-ray properties. We processed the raw,
public X-ray data using the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations and
determined and analyzed different structural parameters in order to produce a
morphological classification of X-ray sources. Finally, we analyzed the angular
clustering of these sources using 2-point correlation functions. We present a
catalog of 340 X-ray emitters with optical counterpart. We obtained the number
counts and compared them with AEGIS data. Objects have been classified by
nuclear type using a diagnostic diagram relating X-ray-to-optical ratio (X/O)
to hardness ratio (HR). Also, we combined structural parameters with other
X-ray and optical properties, and found for the first time an anticorrelation
between the X/O ratio and the Abraham concentration index which might suggest
that early type galaxies have lower Eddington rates than those of late type
galaxies. A significant positive angular clustering was obtained from a
preliminary analysis of 4 subsamples of the X-ray sources catalog. The
clustering signal of the opticaly extended counterparts is similar to that of
strongly clustered populations like red and very red galaxies, suggesting that
the environment plays an important role in AGN phenomena."
"The question in the title may be answered by considering the outcome of a
``weak measurement'' in the sense of Aharonov et al. Various properties of the
resulting time are discussed, including its close relation to the Larmor times.
It is a universal description of a broad class of measurement interactions, and
its physical implications are unambiguous."
"We analyse the elastic energy of an intercalated smectic where
orientationally ordered polymers with an average orientation varying from layer
to layer are intercalated between smectic planes. The lowest order terms in the
coupling between polymer director and smectic layer curvature are added to the
smectic elastic energy. Integration over the smectic degrees of freedom leaves
an effective polymer twist energy that has to be included into the total
polymer elastic energy leading to a fluctuational renormalization of the
intercalated polymer twist modulus. If the polymers are chiral this in its turn
leads to a renormalization of the cholesteric pitch."
"The convergence of recent advances in optical fabrication and digital
processing yields a new generation of imaging technology: light-field cameras,
which bridge the realms of applied mathematics, optics, and high-performance
computing. Herein for the first time, we introduce the paradigm of light-field
imaging into laryngoscopy. The resultant probe can image the three-dimensional
(3D) shape of vocal folds within a single camera exposure. Furthermore, to
improve the spatial resolution, we developed an image fusion algorithm,
providing a simple solution to a long-standing problem in light-field imaging."
"We analyze the long-term tidal evolution of a single-planet system through
the use of numerical simulations and averaged equations giving the variations
of semi-major axis and eccentricity of the relative orbit. For different types
of planets, we compute the variations due to the planetary and stellar tides.
Then, we calculate the critical value of the eccentricity for which the stellar
tide becomes dominant over the planetary tide. The timescales for orbital decay
and circularization are also discussed and compared."
"We show how to extract messages masked by a chaotic signal of a time-delay
system with very high dimension and many positive Lyapunov exponents. Using a
special embedding coordinate, the infinite dimensional phase space of the
time-delay system is projected to a special three-dimensional space, which
enables us to identify the time-delay of the system from the transmitted
signal, and reconstruct the chaotic dynamics to unmask the hidden message
successfully. The message extraction procedure is illustrated by simulations
with Mackey-Glass time-delay system for two type of masking schemes and
different kinds of messages."
"Water masers are found in dense molecular clouds closely associated with
supermassive black holes in the centres of active galaxies. Based upon the
understanding of the local water maser luminosity function, it was expected
that masers at intermediate and high redshifts would be extremely rare, but
galaxies at redshifts z > 2 might be quite different from those found locally,
not least because of more frequent mergers and interaction events. Using
gravitational lensing as a tool to enable us to search higher redshifts than
would otherwise be possible, we have embarked on a survey of lensed galaxies,
looking for masers. Here we report the discovery of a water maser at redshift
2.64 in the dust- and gas-rich gravitationally lensed type 1 quasar MG
J0414+0534, which, with an isotropic luminosity of 10,000 L_solar, is twice as
luminous as the most powerful local water maser, and half that of the most
distant maser previously known. Using the locally-determined luminosity
function, the probability of finding a maser this luminous associated with any
single active galaxy is 10^{-6}. The fact that we saw such a maser in the first
galaxy we observed must mean that the volume densities and luminosities of
masers are higher at redshift 2.64."
"We consider the basic features of complex dynamic and control systems,
including systems having hierarchical structure. Special attention is paid to
the problems of design and synthesis of complex systems and control models, and
to the development of simulation techniques and systems. A model of complex
system is proposed and briefly analyzed."
"The Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which arises from the large $U$ Hubbard
model, is investigated on the $C_{60}$ molecule and other fullerenes. The
connectivity of $C_{60}$ leads to an exotic classical ground state with
nontrivial topology. We argue that there is no phase transition in the Hubbard
model as a function of $U/t$, and thus the large $U$ solution is relevant for
the physical case of intermediate coupling. The system undergoes a first order
metamagnetic phase transition. We also consider the S=1/2 case using
perturbation theory. Experimental tests are suggested."
"The temperature dependence of both components of the resistivity tensor
$\varrho_{xx}(T)$ and $\varrho_{xy}(T)$ has been studied at T $\geq$ 4.2 K
within IQHE plateaux around filling factors \nu=2 and \nu=4 of medium-
-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. In the middle of the mobility gap
standard activated conductivity has been found with activation energies $\Delta
$ scaling well with $\hbar\omega_{c} / 2$ . At filling factors slightly below
$\nu$=2 another contribution adds to the activated conductivity at T $\leq$ 12
K. This additional contribution can be further enhanced at higher mesuring d.c.
currents.We suggest, that it arises due to enhanced electric field assisted
tunneling across potential barriers separating localized states within the bulk
of the sample.This effect contributes to the backscattering across the sample
leading to an enhanced longitudinal conductivity. The additional contribution
to $\sigma_{xx}(T)$ can be reasonably well fitted to the formula for the
variable range hopping in strong magnetic fields indicating that the hopping
can persist even at temperatures well above 4.2K."
"Some spontaneously broken gauge theories with left couplings to fermions,
like the abelian model that we propose here, can be endowed with a composite
scalar sector and Wess-Zumino field ; their quantization in the functionnal
integral formalism accordingly requires the introduction of constraints that,
together with the breaking of the gauge symmetry by the scalars, and among
other consequences, give the Higgs field and the fermions (quarks) infinite
masses; this makes them unobservable. Gauge invariance and unitarity are
achieved through a derivative coupling of the W-Z field to the fermionic
current; the anomaly gets cancelled in the above infinite fermion mass limit.
We show how the problems of renormalizability are evaded at the one-loop level
by resumming diagrams at the ladder approximation and reshuffling the
perturbative series, and because the fermionic current is conserved. The
Wess-Zumino field can be ""gauged away"" to become the 3rd polarization of the
massive gauge field; the pseudoscalar partner of the Higgs, tightly linked to
the W-Z field, behaves like an abelian pion. In particular, no extra scale of
interaction has to be introduced, unlike in ""technicolour"" theories. Problems
concerning the leptonic sector are only mentionned."
"We study the effect of electron-electron (e-e) interactions on
compressibility, capacitance and inverse compressibility of electrons in a
quantum dot or a small metallic grain. The calculation is performed in the
random-phase approximation. As expected, the ensemble-averaged compressibility
and capacitance decreases as a function of the interaction strength, while the
mean inverse compressibility increases. Fluctuations of the compressibility are
found to be strongly suppressed by the e-e interactions. Fluctuations of the
capacitance and inverse compressibility also turn out to be much smaller than
their averages. The analytical calculations are compared with the results of a
numerical calculation for the inverse compressibility of a disordered
tight-binding model. Excellent agreement for weak interaction values is found.
Implications for the interpretation of current experimental data are discussed."
"The main scope of this paper is to show how tools from quantum mechanics, in
particular the Schroedinger equation, can be used to construct an adaptive
transform suitable for signal and image processing applications. The proposed
dictionary is obtained by considering the signal or image as a discrete
potential in Schroedinger equation, further used to construct the Hamiltonien
operator. In order to illustrate its practical interest in signal and image
processing, we provide denoising results in the case of signal-dependent noise,
which is the noise type the most adapted to the proposed approach."
"We present a detailed study of the dynamics of electronic wavepackets in
Fibonacci semiconductor superlattices, both in flat band conditions and subject
to homogeneous electric fields perpendicular to the layers. Coherent
propagation of electrons is described by means of a scalar Hamiltonian using
the effective-mass approximation. We have found that an initial Gaussian
wavepacket is filtered selectively when passing through the superlattice. This
means that only those components of the wavepacket whose wavenumber belong to
allowed subminibands of the fractal-like energy spectrum can propagate over the
entire superlattice. The Fourier pattern of the transmitted part of the
wavepacket presents clear evidences of fractality reproducing those of the
underlying energy spectrum. This phenomenon persists even in the presence of
unintentional disorder due to growth imperfections. Finally, we have
demonstrated that periodic coherent-field induced oscillations (Bloch
oscillations), which we are able to observe in our simulations of periodic
superlattices, are replaced in Fibonacci superlattices by more complex
oscillations displaying quasiperiodic signatures, thus sheding more light onto
the very peculiar nature of the electronic states in these systems."
"We investigate second order additive invariants in elementary cellular
automata rules. Fundamental diagrams of rules which possess additive invariants
are either linear or exhibit singularities similar to singularities of rules
with first-order invariant. Only rules which have exactly one invariants
exhibit singularities. At the singularity, the current decays to its
equilibrium value as a power law $t^{\alpha}$, and the value of the exponent
$\alpha$ obtained from numerical simulations is very close to -1/2. This is in
agreements with values previously reported for number-conserving rules, and
leads to a conjecture that regardless of the order of the invariant, exponent
$\alpha$ seems to have a universal value of 1/2."
"We have measured the critical velocity v_c at which 3He-A in a rotating
cylinder becomes unstable against the formation of quantized vortex lines with
continuous (singularity-free) core structure. We find that v_c is distributed
between a maximum and minimum limit, which we ascribe to a dependence on the
texture of the orbital angular momentum l(r) in the cylinder. Slow cool down
through T_c in rotation yields l(r) textures for which the measured v_c's are
in good agreement with the calculated instability of the expected l texture."
"This is a transcript of lectures given at the Sixth Jorge Andre Swieca Summer
School in Theoretical Physics. The subject of these lectures is soliton
solutions of string theory. We construct a class of exact conformal field
theories possessing a spacetime soliton or instanton interpretation and present
a preliminary discussion of their physical properties."
"We consider a smectic-A* in a capillary with surface anchoring that favors
parallel alignment. If the bulk phase of the smectic is the standard
twist-grain-boundary phase of chiral smectics, then there will be a critical
radius below which the smectic will not have any topological defects. Above
this radius a single screw dislocation in the center of the capillary will be
favored. Along with surface anchoring, a magnetic field will also suppress the
formation of a screw dislocation. In this note, we calculate the critical field
at which a defect is energetically preferred as a function of the surface
anchoring strength and the capillary radius. Experiments at a few different
radii could thus determine the anchoring strength."
"The strong coupling alpha_s(M_Z^2) has been measured using hadronic decays of
Z^0 bosons collected by the SLD experiment at SLAC. The data were compared with
QCD predictions both at fixed order, O(alpha_s^2), and including resummed
analytic formulae based on the next-to-leading logarithm approximation. In this
comprehensive analysis we studied event shapes, jet rates, particle
correlations, and angular energy flow, and checked the consistency between
alpha_s(M_Z^2) values extracted from these different measures. Combining all
results we obtain alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1200 \pm 0.0025(exp.) \pm 0.0078(theor.),
where the dominant uncertainty is from uncalculated higher order contributions."
"We present the first results from the E864 collaboration on the production of
antiprotons in 10% central 11.5 A GeV/c Au+Pb nucleus collisions at the
Brookhaven AGS. We report invariant multiplicities for antiproton production in
the kinematic region 1.4<y<2.2 and 50<p_T<300 MeV/c, and compare our data with
a first collision scaling model and previously published results from the E878
collaboration. The differences between the E864 and E878 antiproton
measurements and the implications for antihyperon production are discussed."
"H-alpha emission from neutral halo clouds probes the radiation and
hydrodynamic conditions in the halo. Armed with such measurements, we can
explore how radiation escapes from the Galactic plane and how infalling gas can
survive a trip through the halo. The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is one of
the most sensitive instruments for detecting and mapping optical emission from
the ISM. Here, we present recent results exploring the ionization of two
infallling high-velocity complexes. First, we report on our progress mapping
H-alpha emission covering the full extent of Complex A. Intensities are faint
(<100 mR; EM <0.2 pc cm^-6 but correlate on the sky and in velocity with 21-cm
emission. Second, we explore the ionized component of some Anti-Center Complex
clouds studied by Peek et al. (2007) that show dynamic shaping from interaction
with the Galactic halo."
"We study an anomalous behavior of the height fluctuation width in the
crossover from random to coherent growths of surface for a stochastic model. In
the model, random numbers are assigned on perimeter sites of surface,
representing pinning strengths of disordered media. At each time, surface is
advanced at the site having minimum pinning strength in a random subset of
system rather than having global minimum. The subset is composed of a randomly
selected site and its $(\ell-1)$ neighbors. The height fluctuation width
$W^2(L;\ell)$ exhibits the non-monotonic behavior with $\ell$ and it has a
minimum at $\ell^*$. It is found numerically that $\ell^*$ scales as
$\ell^*\sim L^{0.59}$, and the height fluctuation width at that minimum,
$W^2(L;\ell^*)$, scales as $\sim L^{0.85}$ in 1+1 dimensions. It is found that
the subset-size $\ell^*(L)$ is the characteristic size of the crossover from
the random surface growth in the KPZ universality, to the coherent surface
growth in the directed percolation universality."
"A large class of solutions of the Einstein-conformal scalar equations in
D=2+1 and D=3+1 is identified. They describe the collisions of asymptotic
conformal scalar waves and are generated from Einstein-minimally coupled scalar
spacetimes via a (generalized) Bekenstein transformation. Particular emphasis
is given to the study of the global properties and the singularity structure of
the obtained solutions. It is shown, that in the case of the absence of pure
gravitational radiation in the initial data, the formation of the final
singularity is not only generic, but is even inevitable."
"An ""exact discretization"" of the Schroedinger operator is considered and its
direct and inverse scattering problems are solved. It is shown that a
differential-difference nonlinear evolution equation depending on two arbitrary
constants can be solved by using this spectral transform and that for a special
choice of the constants it can be considered an integrable discretization of
the KdV equation at large times. An integrable difference-difference equation
is also obtained."
"Physicists and physics students have been studied with respect to the
variation in ways they expound on their topic of research and a physics
problem, respectively. A phenomenographic approach has been employed; six
fourth-year physics students and ten teacher/researcher physicists at various
stages of their careers have been interviewed. Four qualitatively distinct ways
of expounding on physics have been identified, constituting an outcome space
where there is a successive shift towards coherent structure and multiple
referent domains. The interviewed person is characterised as expressing an
'object of knowledge' and the interviewer is characterised as a willing and
active listener who is trying to make sense of it, constituting a 'knowledge
object' out of the ideas, data and personal experience. Pedagogical situations
of analogous character to the interviewer-interviewee discussions are
considered in the light of the analysis, focusing on the affordances for
learning offered by the different forms of exposition."
"The stability of antiferromagnetic long-range order against quenched disorder
is considered. A simple model of an antiferromagnet with a spatially varying
Neel temperature is shown to possess a nontrivial fixed point corresponding to
long-range order that is stable unless either the order parameter or the
spatial dimensionality exceeds a critical value. The instability of this fixed
point corresponds to the system entering a random-singlet phase. The
stabilization of long-range order is due to quantum fluctuations, whose role in
determining the phase diagram is discussed."
"It is shown, that any sufficiently smooth periodic solution of the
self-focusing Nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation can be approximated by periodic
finite-gap ones with an arbitrary small error. As a corollary an analogous
result for the motion of closed curves in ${\Bbb R}^3$ guided by the Filament
equation is proved. This equation describes the dynamics of very thin filament
vortices in a fluid."
"We present spin relaxation times of 2D holes obtained by means of spin
sensitive bleaching of the absorption of infrared radiation in p-type
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells (QWs). It is shown that the saturation of
inter-subband absorption of circularly polarized radiation is mainly controlled
by the spin relaxation time of the holes. The saturation behavior has been
determined for different QW widths and in a wide temperature range with the
result that the saturation intensity substantially decreases with narrowing of
the QWs. Spin relaxation times are derived from the measured saturation
intensities by making use of calculated (linear) absorption coefficients for
direct inter-subband transitions. It is shown that spin relaxation is due to
the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism governed by hole-hole scattering. The problem of
selection rules is addressed."
"We study the constraints which the next generation of radio telescopes could
place on the mass and number of neutrino species by studying the gravitational
lensing of high redshift 21 cm emission in combination with wide-angle surveys
of galaxy lensing. We use simple characterizations of reionization history and
of proposed telescope designs to forecast the constraints and detectability
threshold for neutrinos. It is found that the degeneracy between neutrino
parameters and dark energy parameters is significantly reduced by incorporating
21 cm lensing. The combination of galaxy and 21 cm lensing could constrain the
sum of the neutrino masses to within ~ 0.04 eV and the number of species to
within ~ 0.1. This is an improvement of a factor of 2.6 in mass and 1.3 in
number over a galaxy lensing survey alone. This includes marginalizing over an
11 parameter cosmological model with a two parameter model for the dark energy
equation of state. If the dark energy equation of state is held fixed at w =
p/\rho=-1 the constraints improve to ~0.03 eV and 0.04. These forecasted errors
depend critically on the fraction of sky that can be surveyed in redshifted 21
cm emission (25% is assumed here) and the redshift of reionization ($z=7$ is
assumed here). It is also found that neutrinos with masses too small to be
detected in the data could none the less cause a significant bias in the
measured dark energy equation of state."
"We investigate a dynamic model of network marketing in a small-world network
structure artificially constructed similarly to the Watts-Strogatz network
model. Different from the traditional marketing, consumers can also play the
role of the manufacturer's selling agents in network marketing, which is
stimulated by the referral fee the manufacturer offers. As the wiring
probability $\alpha$ is increased from zero to unity, the network changes from
the one-dimensional regular directed network to the star network where all but
one player are connected to one consumer. The price $p$ of the product and the
referral fee $r$ are used as free parameters to maximize the profit of the
manufacturer. It is observed that at $\alpha=0$ the maximized profit is
constant independent of the network size $N$ while at $\alpha \neq 0$, it
increases linearly with $N$. This is in parallel to the small-world transition.
It is also revealed that while the optimal value of $p$ stays at an almost
constant level in a broad range of $\alpha$, that of $r$ is sensitive to a
change in the network structure. The consumer surplus is also studied and
discussed."
"The paper pursues two aims. First, to revisit the classical electromagnetic
mass theory and develop it further by making use of a corollary of general
relativity - that the propagation of light in non-inertial reference frames is
anisotropic. Second, to show that the same type of acceleration-dependent
self-interaction effects that give rise to the inertia and mass of the
classical electron appear in quantum field theory as well when the general
relativistic frequency shift of the virtual quanta, mediating the
electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions between non-inertial particles,
is taken into account. Those effects may account for the origin of inertia and
mass of macroscopic objects."
"The production of pairs of fast atoms leads to a pronounced loss of atoms
during upward ramps of Feshbach resonance levels in dilute Bose-Einstein
condensates. We provide comparative studies on the formation of these bursts of
atoms containing the physical predictions of several theoretical approaches at
different levels of approximation. We show that despite their very different
description of the microscopic binary physics during the passage of a Feshbach
resonance, all approaches lead to virtually the same prediction on the total
loss of condensate atoms, provided that the ramp of the magnetic field strength
is purely linear. We give the reasons for this remarkable insensitivity of the
remnant condensate fraction to the microscopic physical processes and compare
the theoretical predictions with recent Feshbach resonance crossing experiments
on 23Na and 85Rb."
"A dynamic system, which is used in the neural network theory, Ising spin
glasses and factor analysis, has been investigated. The properties of the
connection matrix, which guarantee the coincidence of the set of the fixed
points of the dynamic system with the set of the local minima of the energy
functional, have been determined. The influence of the connection matrix
diagonal elements on the structure of the fixed points set has been
investigated."
"The silicon nanowire transistor (SNWT) is a promising device structure for
future integrated circuits, and simulations will be important for understanding
its device physics and assessing its ultimate performance limits. In this work,
we present a three-dimensional quantum mechanical simulation approach to treat
various SNWTs within the effective-mass approximation. We begin by assuming
ballistic transport, which gives the upper performance limit of the devices.
The use of a mode space approach (either coupled or uncoupled) produces high
computational efficiency that makes our 3D quantum simulator practical for
extensive device simulation and design. Scattering in SNWTs is then treated by
a simple model that uses so-called Buttiker probes, which was previously used
in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) simulations.
Using this simple approach, the effects of scattering on both internal device
characteristics and terminal currents can be examined, which enables our
simulator to be used for the exploration of realistic performance limits of
SNWTs."
"We present a nonequilibrium kinetic theory describing atom-molecule
population dynamics in a two-component Fermi gas with a Feshbach resonance. Key
collision integrals emerge that govern the relaxation of the atom-molecule
mixture to chemical and thermal equilibrium. Our focus is on the pseudogap
regime where molecules form above the superfluid transition temperature. In
this regime, we formulate a simple model for the atom-molecule population
dynamics. The model predicts the saturation of molecule formation that has been
observed in recent experiments, and indicates that a dramatic enhancement of
the atom-molecule conversion efficiency occurs at low temperatures."
"In a recent Letter Balatsky and Salkola made their conclusion about the
absence of localization in disordered d-wave superconductors exploiting the
idea that strongly overlapping impurity states formed a network capable to
provide the transport. We present here the correct estimate of hopping matrix
elements between two impurities which were the basic quantities for the
subsequent consideration in the abovementioned Letter. We conclude, that the
picture of the impurity-impurity potential acting only within the slowly
broadening tails claimed by Balatsky and Salkola as well as all the physical
consequences of this picture appear to be incorrect."
"We find new solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation in terms of the
intertwiner matrix for semi-cyclic representations of the quantum group
$U_q(s\ell(2))$ with $q= e^{2\pi i/N}$. These intertwiners serve to define the
Boltzmann weights of a lattice model, which shares some similarities with the
chiral Potts model. An alternative interpretation of these Boltzmann weights is
as scattering matrices of solitonic structures whose kinematics is entirely
governed by the quantum group. Finally, we consider the limit $N\to\infty$
where we find an infinite--dimensional representation of the braid group, which
may give rise to an invariant of knots and links."
"A simple model of a polymer with long rigid segments which interact via
excluded volume repulsions and short ranged attractions is proposed. The
coil-globule transition of this model polymer is strongly first order, the
globule is crystalline and the coil which coexists with the globule is swollen.
A virial expansion truncated at low order is shown to provide a very poor
approximation to the free energy and so a cell theory is used to calculate the
free energy of the globule."
"A Stirling engine of the type used for demonstration purposes has been
outfitted with a pair of sensors that measure pressure and piston displacement
when the engine is operating with a small temperature difference between the
hot and cold reservoirs. Measured variables are compared against computer
generated output based on a simple theory that involves nonlinear equations of
motion. Theory and experiment are found to be in reasonable agreement.
Temperature dependence of the graph of pressure versus piston displacement, for
different directions of flywheel rotation, permits a better understanding of
the physics of heat engines and refrigerators in general."
"We discuss relationship between inflation and various models of production of
density inhomogeneities due to strings, global monopoles, textures and other
topological and non-topological defects. Neither of these models leads to a
consistent cosmological theory without the help of inflation. However, each of
these models can be incorporated into inflationary cosmology. We propose a
model of inflationary phase transitions, which, in addition to topological and
non-topological defects, may provide adiabatic density perturbations with a
sharp maximum between the galaxy scale $l_g$ and the horizon scale $l_H$."
"The so-called Vegetation Red-Edge (VRE), a sharp increase in the reflectance
around $700 nm$, is a characteristic of vegetation spectra, and can therefore
be used as a biomarker if it can be detected in an unresolved extrasolar
Earth-like planet integrated reflectance spectrum. Here we investigate the
potential for detection of vegetation spectra during the last Quaternary
climatic extrema, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene optimum, for
which past climatic simulations have been made. By testing the VRE
detectability during these extrema when Earth's climate and biomes maps were
different from today, we are able to test the vegetation detectability on a
terrestrial planet different from our modern Earth. Data from the Biome3.5
model have been associated to visible GOME spectra for each biome and cloud
cover to derive Earth's integrated spectra for given Earth phases and observer
positions. The VRE is then measured. Results show that the vegetation remains
detectable during the last climatic extrema. Compared to current Earth, the
Holocene optimum with a greener Sahara slightly increases the mean VRE on one
hand, while on the other hand, the large ice cap over the northern Hemisphere
during the LGM decreases vegetation detectability. We finally discuss the
detectability of the VRE in the context of recently proposed space missions."

"We propose a model of magnetic connection (MC) of a black hole with its
surrounding accretion disc based on large-scale magnetic field. The MC gives
rise to transport of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the
disc, and the closed field lines pipe the hot matter evaporated from the disc,
and shape it in the corona above the disc to form a magnetically induced
disc-corona system, in which the corona has the same configuration as the
large-scale magnetic field. We numerically solve the dynamic equations in the
context of the Kerr metric, in which the large-scale magnetic field is
determined by dynamo process and equipartition between magnetic pressure and
gas pressure. Thus we can obtain a global solution rather than assuming the
distribution of large-scale magnetic field beforehand. The main MC effects lie
in three aspects. (1) The rotational energy of a fast-spinning black hole can
be extracted, enhancing the dissipation in the accretion disc, (2) the closed
field lines provide a natural channel for corona matter escaping from disc and
finally falling into black hole, and (3) the scope of the corona can be bounded
by the conservation of magnetic flux. We simulate the high-energy spectra of
this system by using Monte-Carlo method, and find that the relative hardness of
the spectra decreases as accretion rate or black hole spin $a_*$ increases. We
fit the typical X-ray spectra of three black-hole binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE
1118+480 and GX 339-4) in the low/hard or very high state."
"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on the limiting eigenvalue ratio of the
covariance matrix offers superior detection performance and overcomes the noise
uncertainty problem. While an exact expression exists, it is complex and
multiple useful approximate expressions have been published in the literature.
An improved, more accurate, integral solution for the probability density
function of the ratio is derived using order statistical analysis to remove the
simplifying, but incorrect, independence assumption. Thereby, the letter makes
an advance in the rigorous theory of eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing."
"We study the collisional loss of atom-molecule coherence after coherently
dissociating a small fraction of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate into
atoms. The obtained $n$-atoms states are two-atom (SU(1,1)) coherent states
with number variance $\Delta n\propto n$ compared to $\Delta n\propto \sqrt{n}$
for the spin (SU(2)) coherent states formed by coherent splitting of an atomic
condensate. Consequently, the Lorentzian atom-molecule phase-diffusion is
faster than the Gaussian phase-diffusion between separated atomic condensates,
by a $\sqrt{n}$ factor."
"The idea of new diagnostics method for the small-scale irregular structures
of magnetically confined plasma is suggested in the present paper. The method
can be based on measurements of intensity attenuation of the normal sounding
waves. Anomalous attenuation arises due to multiple scattering effects
investigated earlier for ionospheric radio propagation. It has been shown that
multiple scattering regime can realize in a tokamak plasma. Calculations of
normal sounding wave anomalous attenuation in a tokamak plasma have been
carried out. This quantity is large enough to be registered experimentally."
"We present, for the first time, spectral behaviour of aerosol optical depths
(AODs) over Manora Peak, Nainital located at an altitude of $\sim$ 2 km in the
Shivalik ranges of central Himalayas. The observations were carried out using a
Multi-Wavelength solar Radiometer during January to December 2002. The main
results of the study are extremely low AODs during winter, a remarkable
increase to high values in summer and a distinct change in the spectral
dependencies of AODs from a relatively steeper spectra during winter to a
shallower one in summer. During transparent days, the AOD values lie usually
below 0.08 while during dusty (turbid) days, it lies between 0.08 to 0.69 at
0.5 $\mu$m. The average AOD value at 0.5 $\mu$m during winters, particularly in
January and February, is $\sim 0.03\pm0.01$. The mean aerosol extinction law at
Manora Peak during 2002 is best represented by $0.10 \lambda^{-0.61}$. However
during transparent days, which almost covers 40% of the time, it is represented
by $0.02 \lambda^{-0.97}$. This value of wavelength exponent, representing
reduced coarse concentration and presence of fine aerosols, indicates that the
station measures aerosol in the free troposphere at least during part of the
year."
"In recent years several new Majoron models were invented to avoid
shortcomings of the classical models while leading to observable decay rates in
double beta experiments. We give the first experimental half life bounds on
double beta decays with new Majoron emission and derive bounds on the effective
neutrino--Majoron couplings from the data of the $^{76}Ge$ HEIDELBERG--MOSCOW
experiment. While stringent half life limits for all decay modes and the
coupling constants of the classical models were obtained, small matrix elements
and phase space integrals \cite{hir95,pae95} result in much weaker limits on
the effective coupling constants of the new Majoron models."
"We present the structure function ratios F2(Li)/F2(D) and F2(C)/F2(D)
measured in deep inelastic muon-nucleus scattering at a nominal incident muon
energy of 200 GeV. The kinematic range 0.0001 < x < 0.7 and 0.01< Q^2 < 70
GeV^2 is covered. For values of $x$ less than $0.002$ both ratios indicate
saturation of shadowing at values compatible with photoabsorption results."
"We report on a methodology for the evaluation of the DC characteristics,
small-signal frequency response and large-signal dynamic response of carrier
and photon density responses in semiconductor laser diodes. A single mode laser
is considered and described with a pair of rate equations containing a novel
non-linear gain compensation term depending on a single parameter that can be
chosen arbitrarily. This approach can be applied to any type of solid-state
laser as long as it is described by a set of rate equations."
"We study both analytically and numerically phonon transmission fluctuations
and localization in partially ordered superlattices with correlations among
neighboring layers. In order to generate a sequence of layers with a varying
degree of order we employ a model proposed by Hendricks and Teller as well as
partially ordered versions of deterministic aperiodic superlattices. By
changing a parameter measuring the correlation among adjacent layers, the
Hendricks- Teller superlattice exhibits a transition from periodic ordering,
with alterna- ting layers, to the phase separated opposite limit; including
many intermediate arrangements and the completely random case. In the partially
ordered versions of deterministic superlattices, there is short-range order
(among any $N$ conse- cutive layers) and long range disorder, as in the N-state
Markov chains. The average and fluctuations in the transmission, the
backscattering rate, and the localization length in these multilayered systems
are calculated based on the superlattice structure factors we derive
analytically. The standard deviation of the transmission versus the average
transmission lies on a {\it universal\/} curve irrespective of the specific
type of disorder of the SL. We illustrate these general results by applying
them to several GaAs-AlAs superlattices for the proposed experimental
observation of phonon universal transmission fluctuations."
"We present the first statistical analysis of 27 UVOT optical/ultra-violet
lightcurves of GRB afterglows. We have found, through analysis of the
lightcurves in the observer's frame, that a significant fraction rise in the
first 500s after the GRB trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,
typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decay
indices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.
We find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of the
forward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, or
geometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as an
increasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occurs
as the jet slows. We find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, in
the observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400s
and the rate of decay after 500s. However, in the rest frame a Spearman Rank
test shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance between
luminosity and decay rate. A correlation should be expected if the afterglows
were produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from within
the half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy density
theta_c. We also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three rest
frame epochs. We find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.
Finally, we compare our sample of UVOT lightcurves with the XRT lightcurve
canonical model. The range in decay indices seen in UVOT lightcurves at any
epoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of the
XRT canonical model. However, in the XRT canonical model there is no indication
of the rising behaviour observed in the UVOT lightcurves."
"The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a common tool in the frequency analysis of
unequally spaced data equivalent to least-squares fitting of sine waves. We
give an analytic solution for the generalisation to a full sine wave fit,
including an offset and weights ($\chi^{2}$ fitting). Compared to the
Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the generalisation is superior as it provides more
accurate frequencies, is less susceptible to aliasing, and gives a much better
determination of the spectral intensity. Only a few modifications are required
for the computation and the computational effort is similar. Our approach
brings together several related methods that can be found in the literature,
viz. the date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, the floating-mean
periodogram, and the ""spectral significance"" estimator used in the SigSpec
program, for which we point out some equivalences. Furthermore, we present an
algorithm that implements this generalisation for the evaluation of the
Keplerian periodogram that searches for the period of the best-fitting
Keplerian orbit to radial velocity data. The systematic and non-random
algorithm is capable of detecting eccentric orbits, which is demonstrated by
two examples and can be a useful tool in searches for the orbital periods of
exoplanets."
"We analyse the nonlinear behaviour of a third-order class-D amplifier, and
demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple
compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The
amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of
rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal
(pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the
steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability,
we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer
function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows
how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the
device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation
of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between
the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the
amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the
SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved
through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and
illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the
amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is
rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear
negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal
that slowly modulates the system parameters."
"The geometry of the spinning black holes of standard Einstein theory in 2+1
dimensions, with a negative cosmological constant and without couplings to
matter, is analyzed in detail. It is shown that the black hole arises from
identifications of points of anti-de Sitter space by a discrete subgroup of
$SO(2,2)$. The generic black hole is a smooth manifold in the metric sense. The
surface $r=0$ is not a curvature singularity but, rather, a singularity in the
causal structure. Continuing past it would introduce closed timelike lines.
However, simple examples show the regularity of the metric at $r=0$ to be
unstable: couplings to matter bring in a curvature singularity there. Kruskal
coordinates and Penrose diagrams are exhibited. Special attention is given to
the limiting cases of (i) the spinless hole of zero mass, which differs from
anti-de Sitter space and plays the role of the vacuum, and (ii) the spinning
hole of maximal angular momentum . A thorough classification of the elements of
the Lie algebra of $SO(2,2)$ is given in an Appendix."
"A probabilistic technique for the joint estimation of background and sources
with the aim of detecting faint and extended celestial objects is described.
Bayesian probability theory is applied to gain insight into the coexistence of
background and sources through a probabilistic two-component mixture model,
which provides consistent uncertainties of background and sources. A
multi-resolution analysis is used for revealing faint and extended objects in
the frame of the Bayesian mixture model. All the revealed sources are
parameterized automatically providing source position, net counts,
morphological parameters and their errors."
"The frequency distribution of different parameters of an EXAFS spectrum can
be directly sampled by analysing a population of simulated spectra produced by
adding computer-generated noise to a reference pattern. The procedure gives
statistical estimators of the parameter obtained with different data processing
strategies to test the performance of a strategy, to evaluate the bias
introduced by random noise, and to clarify the amount of information actually
contained in an experimental spectrum. Examples are given for the two simple
local structures of an Ag atom sorrounded by two oxygens or by six iodines."
"We study the effect of an electric charge in the middle of a ring of
electrons in a magnetic field such as $\nu = 1/2$. In the absence of the
central charge, a residual current should appear due to an Aharanov-Bohm
effect. As the charge varies, periodic currents should appear in the ring. We
evaluate the amplitude of these currents, as well as their period as the
central charge varies. The presence of these currents should be a direct
signature of the existence of a statistical gauge field in the $\nu=1/2$
quantum Hall effect. Numerical diagonalizations for a small number of electrons
on the sphere are also carried out. The numerical results up to 9 electrons are
qualitatively consistent with the mean field picture."
"The motion of electrons and ions in medium-sized rare gas clusters (1000
atoms) exposed to intense laser pulses is studied microscopically by means of
classical molecular dynamics using a hierarchical tree code. Pulse parameters
for optimum ionization are found to be wavelength dependent. This resonant
behavior is traced back to a collective electron oscillation inside the charged
cluster. It is shown that this dynamics can be well described by a driven and
damped harmonic oscillator allowing for a clear discrimination against other
energy absorption mechanisms."
"There have been suggestions to measure atomic parity nonconservation (PNC)
along an isotopic chain, by taking ratios of observables in order to cancel
complicated atomic structure effects. Precise atomic PNC measurements could
make a significant contribution to tests of the Standard Model at the level of
one loop radiative corrections. However, the results also depend upon certain
features of nuclear structure, such as the spatial distribution of neutrons in
the nucleus. To examine the sensitivity to nuclear structure, we consider the
case of Pb isotopes using various recent relativistic and non-relativistic
nuclear model calculations. Contributions from nucleon internal weak structure
are included, but found to be fairly negligible. The spread among present
models in predicted sizes of nuclear structure effects may preclude using Pb
isotope ratios to test the Standard Model at better than a one percent level,
unless there are adequate independent tests of the nuclear models by various
alternative strong and electroweak nuclear probes. On the other hand,
sufficiently accurate atomic PNC experiments would provide a unique method to
measure neutron distributions in heavy nuclei."
"We apply methods developed by Lovelace, Lipatov and Kirschner to evaluate the
leading Regge trajectories \alpha(t) with the quantum numbers of nonexotic
quark-antiquark mesons at N_c = infinity and in the limit of t going to minus
infinity. In this region renormalization group improved perturbation theory
should be valid. We discuss the compatibility of nonlinear trajectories with
narrow resonance approximations."
"Various experiments have shown superluminal group and signal velocities
recently. Experiments were essentials carried out with microwave tunnelling,
with frustrated total internal reflection, and with gain-assisted anomalous
dispersion. According to text books a superluminal signal velocity violates
Einstein causality implying that cause and effect can be changed and time
machines known from science fiction could be constructed. This naive analysis,
however, assumes a signal to be a point in the time dimension neglecting its
finite duration. A signal is not presented by a point nor by its front, but by
its total length. On the other hand a signal energy is finite thus its
frequency band is limited, the latter is a fundamental physical property in
consequence of field quantization with quantum $h \nu$. All superluminal
experiments have been carried out with rather narrow frequency bands. The
narrow band width is a condition sine qua non to avoid pulse reshaping of the
signal due to the dispersion relation of the tunnelling barrier or of the
excited gas, respectively. In consequence of the narrow frequency band width
the time duration of the signal is long so that causality is preserved.
However, superluminal signal velocity shortens the otherwise luminal time span
between cause and effect."
"Velocity dispersion $\sigma$, radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ of elliptical
galaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and
defining the so-called ``fundamental plane"". In this {\em Letter} we present
observational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour.
Assuming a relation $L \propto R^{\alpha}\sigma^{2 \beta}$, the best-fit values
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The
dispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly
smaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\sigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We
briefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of
objects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters."
"This paper presents a series of user parameter-free iterative Sparse
Asymptotic Minimum Variance (SAMV) approaches for array processing applications
based on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV) criterion. With the
assumption of abundant snapshots in the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
problem, the signal powers and noise variance are jointly estimated by the
proposed iterative AMV approach, which is later proved to coincide with the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator. We then propose a series of power-based
iterative SAMV approaches, which are robust against insufficient snapshots,
coherent sources and arbitrary array geometries. Moreover, to overcome the
direction grid limitation on the estimation accuracy, the SAMV-Stochastic ML
(SAMV-SML) approaches are derived by explicitly minimizing a closed form
stochastic ML cost function with respect to one scalar parameter, eliminating
the need of any additional grid refinement techniques. To assist the
performance evaluation, approximate solutions to the SAMV approaches are also
provided at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low SNR, respectively.
Finally, numerical examples are generated to compare the performance of the
proposed approaches with existing approaches."
"Criticisms of so called `subjective probability' come on the one hand from
those who maintain that probability in physics has only a frequentistic
interpretation, and, on the other, from those who tend to `objectivise'
Bayesian theory, arguing, e.g., that subjective probabilities are indeed based
`only on private introspection'. Some of the common misconceptions on
subjective probability will be commented upon in support of the thesis that
coherence is the most crucial, universal and `objective' way to assess our
confidence on events of any kind."
"We have observed the cold collision frequency shift of the 1S-2S transition
in trapped spin-polarized atomic hydrogen. We find $\Delta \nu_{1S-2S} =
-3.8(8)\times 10^{-10} n Hz cm^3$, where $n$ is the sample density. From this
we derive the 1S-2S s-wave triplet scattering length, $a_{1S-2S}=-1.4(3)$ nm,
which is in fair agreement with a recent calculation. The shift provides a
valuable probe of the distribution of densities in a trapped sample."
"Starting in the summer of 2007, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collide
proton beams at center-of-mass energies of 14 TeV exceeding by a factor of ten
what was previously achieved. It will be located in the 27km long underground
tunnel, in which the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) was working until
the year 2000. The Large Hadron Collider is a part of the accelerator complex
of the European Laboratory of Particle Physics (CERN), situated on the
Franco-Swiss border close to Geneva."
"Measuring the ESR of Gd spin probes we have studied the magnetic properties
of the copper oxide planes in the low temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase of Eu
doped La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4. The data give evidence that at particular levels of Sr
and Eu doping the frequency of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the LTT
phase dramatically decreases at low temperatures by almost three orders of
magnitude. However, no static magnetic order has been found for T>8K in
contrast to the observation by neutron scattering of stripe ordering of spins
below 50K in a Nd doped La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 single crystal. To our opinion static
order in the Nd doped compound is induced due to the interaction between the Cu
spins with the rare earth magnetic moments. Therefore, a really characteristic
property of the magnetism in the LTT structural phase may be not static
magnetic order at elevated temperatures but rather extremely slow
antiferromagnetic dynamics."
"We use a rotatable torsion balance to perform an equivalence principle test
on a magnetically shielded spin-polarized body of HoFe_{3}. With a rotation
period of one hour, the period of possible signal is reduced from one solar day
by 24 times, and hence the 1/f noise is greatly reduced. Our present
experimental results gives a limit (0.25 +- 1.26) X 10^{-9} on the Eotvos
parameter \eta of equivalence of the polarized body compared with unpolarized
aluminium-brass cylinders in the solar gravitional field, and a limit (0.34 +-
0.52) X 10^{-9} in the earth gravitional fields. This improves the previous
limit on polarized bodies by a factor of 45 for solar field and by a factor of
11 for earth field."
"Gravitation has interesting consequences for plane wave propagation in a
vacuum. The propagation of plane waves with phase velocity directed opposite to
the the time-averaged Poynting vector is investigated for a generally curved
spacetime. Conditions for such negative-phase-velocity (NPV) propagation are
established in terms of the metric components for general and special cases.
The negative energy density implications of NPV propagation are discussed."
"We performed bound state calculations to obtain the first few vibrational
states for the Ar_3 molecular system. The equations used are of Faddeev-type
and are solved directly as three-dimensional equations in configuration space,
i.e. without resorting to an explicit partial wave decomposition. In addition
to realistic pairwise interactions, we employ long range three-body forces. Our
results are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods based on
partial wave expansion and show a significant contribution of the three-body
forces (>10%) to the binding energy and thus their inclusion is, in general,
warranted in studying similar triatomic systems."
"We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their
observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these
characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in
hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial
ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very
satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main
perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of
clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a
distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the
proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects
involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the
saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium
is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all
clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large
scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when
estimating the virial mass of clusters."
"To address the issues of reusability and evolvability in designing self-
describing systems, this paper proposes a pattern-based, object-oriented,
description-driven system architecture. The proposed architecture embodies four
pillars - first, the adoption of a multi-layered meta-modeling architecture and
reflective meta-level architecture, second, the identification of four data
modeling relationships that must be made explicit such that they can be
examined and modified dynamically, third, the identification of five design
patterns which have emerged from practice and have proved essential in
providing reusable building blocks for data management, and fourth, the
encoding of the structural properties of the five design patterns by means of
one pattern, the Graph pattern. The CRISTAL research project served as the
basis onto which the pattern-based meta-object approach has been applied. The
proposed architecture allows the realization of reusability and adaptability,
and is fundamental in the specification of self-describing data management
components."
"The dynamics of a physical system is linked to its phase-space geometry by
Noether's theorem, which holds under standard hypotheses including continuity.
Does an analogous theorem hold for discrete systems? As a testbed, we take the
Ising spin model with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds. We show
that---and why---energy not only acts as a generator of the dynamics for this
family of systems, but is also conserved when the dynamics is time-invariant."
"We present a recursive procedure to calculate the parameters of the recently
introduced multicanonical ensemble and explore the approach for spin glasses.
Temperature dependence of the energy, the entropy and other physical quantities
are easily calculable and we report results for the zero temperature limit. Our
data provide evidence that the large $L$ increase of the ergodicity time is
greatly improved. The multicanonical ensemble seems to open new horizons for
simulations of spin glasses and other systems which have to cope with
conflicting constraints."
"High-contrast imaging of extrasolar planet candidates around a main-sequence
star has recently been realized from the ground using current adaptive optics
(AO) systems. Advancing such observations will be a task for the Gemini Planet
Imager, an upcoming ""extreme"" AO instrument. High-order ""tweeter"" and low-order
""woofer"" deformable mirrors (DMs) will supply a >90%-Strehl correction, a
specialized coronagraph will suppress the stellar flux, and any planets can
then be imaged in the ""dark hole"" region. Residual wavefront error scatters
light into the DM-controlled dark hole, making planets difficult to image above
the noise. It is crucial in this regard that the high-density tweeter, a
micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) DM, have sufficient stroke to deform
to the shapes required by atmospheric turbulence. Laboratory experiments were
conducted to determine the rate and circumstance of saturation, i.e. stroke
insufficiency. A 1024-actuator 1.5-um-stroke MEMS device was empirically tested
with software Kolmogorov-turbulence screens of r_0=10-15cm. The MEMS when
solitary suffered saturation ~4% of the time. Simulating a woofer DM with ~5-10
actuators across a 5-m primary mitigated MEMS saturation occurrence to a
fraction of a percent. While no adjacent actuators were saturated at opposing
positions, mid-to-high-spatial-frequency stroke did saturate more frequently
than expected, implying that correlations through the influence functions are
important. Analytical models underpredict the stroke requirements, so empirical
studies are important."
"We discuss the status of the kilometer-scale neutrino detector IceCube and
its low energy upgrade Deep Core and review its scientific potential for
particle physics. We subsequently appraise IceCube's potential for revealing
the enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. After all, this aspiration set the scale
of the instrument. While only a smoking gun is missing for the case that the
Galactic component of the cosmic ray spectrum originates in supernova remnants,
the origin of the extragalactic component remains as inscrutable as ever. We
speculate on the role of the nearby active galaxies Centaurus A and M87."
"Elastic scattering of pions from finite nuclei is investigated utilizing a
contemporary, momentum--space first--order optical potential combined with
microscopic estimates of second--order corrections. The calculation of the
first--order potential includes:\ \ (1)~full Fermi--averaging integration
including both the delta propagation and the intrinsic nonlocalities in the
$\pi$-$N$ amplitude, (2)~fully covariant kinematics, (3)~use of invariant
amplitudes which do not contain kinematic singularities, and (4)~a
finite--range off--shell pion--nucleon model which contains the nucleon pole
term. The effect of the delta--nucleus interaction is included via the mean
spectral--energy approximation. It is demonstrated that this produces a
convergent perturbation theory in which the Pauli corrections (here treated as
a second--order term) cancel remarkably against the pion true absorption terms.
Parameter--free results, including the delta--nucleus shell--model potential,
Pauli corrections, pion true absorption, and short--range correlations are
presented. (2 figures available from authors)"
"Random links between otherwise distant nodes can greatly facilitate the
propagation of disease or information, provided contagion can be transmitted by
a single active node. However we show that when the propagation requires
simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of activation, called multiplex
propagation, the effect of random links is just the opposite: it makes the
propagation more difficult to achieve. We calculate analytical and numerically
critical points for a threshold model in several classes of complex networks,
including an empirical social network."
"We extend our analysis of the effects of the interplay of quantum phases and
nonlinearity to address saturation effects in small quantum systems.
  We find that initial phases dramatically control the dependence of
self-trapping on initial asymmetry of quasiparticle population and can compete
or act with nonlinearity as well as saturation effects. We find that there is a
minimum finite saturation value in order to obtain self-trapping that crucially
depends on the initial quasiparticle phases and present a detailed
phase-diagram in terms of the control parameters of the system: nonlinearity
and saturation."
"We study the height one, two, three, and four variables in the Abelian
sandpile model. We argue that correlation functions along closed boundaries, as
well as general conformal field theory principles, show that the four variables
are not represented by the same operator along closed boundaries, or in the
bulk. Along open boundaries, we calculate all n-point correlations, and find
that there, all height variables are represented by the same operator. We
introduce dissipative defect points, and show that along open boundaries they
are represented by the same operator as the height variables."
"We consider the joint estimation of multipath channels obtained with a set of
receiving antennas and uniformly probed in the frequency domain. This scenario
fits most of the modern outdoor communication protocols for mobile access or
digital broadcasting among others.
  Such channels verify a Sparse Common Support property (SCS) which was used in
a previous paper to propose a Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) based sampling
and estimation algorithm. In this contribution we improve the robustness and
computational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on
projection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called
the Partial Effective Rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain
robustness.
  If P antennas measure a K-multipath channel with N uniformly sampled
measurements per channel, the algorithm possesses an O(KPNlogN) complexity and
an O(KPN) memory footprint instead of O(PN^3) and O(PN^2) for the direct
implementation, making it suitable for K << N. The sparsity is estimated online
based on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection
being able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking. The estimation performances
are tested on field measurements with synthetic AWGN, and the proposed
algorithm outperforms non-sparse reconstruction in the medium to low SNR range
(< 0dB), increasing the rate of successful symbol decodings by 1/10th in
average, and 1/3rd in the best case. The experiments also show that the
algorithm does not perform worse than a non-sparse estimation algorithm in
non-sparse operating conditions, since it may fall-back to it if the PER
criterion does not detect a sufficient level of sparsity.
  The algorithm is also tested against a method assuming a ""discrete"" sparsity
model as in Compressed Sensing (CS). The conducted test indicates a trade-off
between speed and accuracy."
"We present a simple method for the year-ahead prediction of the number of
hurricanes making landfall in the US. The method is based on averages of
historical annual hurricane numbers, and we perform a backtesting study to find
the length of averaging window that would have given the best predictions in
the past."
"In the standard inflationary scenario with inflaton potential
$V(\Phi)=M^4-{1\over4}\lambda\Phi^4$, the resulting density perturbations
$\delta\rho/\rho$ are proportional to $\lambda^{1/2}$. Upper bounds on
$\delta\rho/\rho$ require $\lambda < 10^{-13}$. Ratra has shown that an
alternative treatment of reheating results in $\delta\rho/\rho \propto
\lambda^{-1}$, so that an upper bound on $\delta\rho/\rho$ does not put an
obvious upper bound on $\lambda$. We verify that $\delta\rho/\rho \propto
\lambda^{-1}$ is indeed a possibility, but show that $\lambda < 10^{-13}$ is
still required."
"The present author has kept observation for concentrations of atmospheric
radon, radon progeny and thoron progeny for several years at the campus of
Fukushima Medical University. Accidentally, in the midst of an observation
term, i.e., February 2005, the facility management group of the university
changed a strategy for the manner of ventilation, probably because of a
recession: (I) tidy everyday ventilation of 7:30-24:00 into (II) shortened
weekday ventilation of 8:00-21:00 with weekend halts. This change of
ventilation manner brought a clear alteration for the concentrations of
radon-related natural radioactivity in indoor air. The present paper concerns
an investigation of the effect of the ventilation strategy on the
indoor-atmospheric radon-related radioactivity."
"Tsallis identified a set of numbers, the q-triplet, (qstat, qsen, qrel), for
a system described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. The deviation of the
q's from unity is a measure of the departure from thermodynamic equilibrium. We
present observations of the q-triplets derived from two sets of daily averages
of the magnetic field strength B observed by Voyager 1 in the solar wind near
40 A.U. during 1989 and near 85 A.U. during 2002, respectively. The results for
1989 do not differ significantly from those for 2002. We find qstat = 1.75,
qsen = -0.6, and qrel = 3.8."
"Surfaces formed by extracellular polymeric substances enclosing individual
and some small communities of {\it Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans} on plates of
hydrophobic silicon and hydrophilic mica are analyzed by means of atomic force
microscopy imaging. Accurate nanoscale descriptions of such coverage surfaces
are obtained. The good agreement with the predictions of a rather simple but
realistic theoretical model allows us to conclude that they correspond, indeed,
to minimal area surfaces enclosing a given volume associated with the encased
bacteria. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first shape
characterization of the coverage formed by these biomolecules, with potential
applications to the study of biofilms."
"A brief review of the manifestations of classical chaos observed in atomic
systems is presented. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of atomic
spectra by periodic orbit-type theories. For diamagnetic non-hydrogenic Rydberg
atoms, the dynamical explanation for observed spectral features has been
disputed. By building on our previous work on the photoabsorption spectrum, we
show how, by the addition of diffractive terms, the spectral fluctuations in
the energy level spectrum of general Rydberg atoms can be obtained with
remarkable precision from the Gutzwiller trace formula. This provides further
evidence that non-hydrogenic systems are most naturally described in terms of
diffraction rather than classical chaos."
"The aim of the article is to investigate the relative dispersion properties
of the Well Mixed class of Lagrangian Stochastic Models. Dimensional analysis
shows that given a model in the class, its properties depend solely on a
non-dimensional parameter, which measures the relative weight of
Lagrangian-to-Eulerian scales. This parameter is formulated in terms of
Kolmogorov constants, and model properties are then studied by modifying its
value in a range that contains the experimental variability. Large variations
are found for the quantity $g^*=2gC_0^{-1}$, where $g$ is the Richardson
constant, and for the duration of the $t^3$ regime. Asymptotic analysis of
model behaviour clarifies some inconsistencies in the literature and excludes
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process from being considered a reliable model for
relative dispersion."
"We present a study of the newly-discovered main-belt comet P/2008 R1
(Garradd), an object with the dynamical characteristics of an asteroid and the
physical characteristics of a comet. Photometry sets a limit to the effective
radius of the nucleus at r_e < 0.7 km (red geometric albedo 0.05 assumed). The
coma shows a secular fading in our data caused by the escape of dust particles
from the near-nucleus environment. The optical reflection spectrum is a nearly
neutral continuum devoid of gaseous emission lines, from which we derive a
limit to the cyanide (CN) radical production rate of Q_CN <1.4e23/s and infer a
mass loss rate <1.5 kg/s at the time of our observations. Unlike the
first-reported main-belt comets, P/2008 R1 is not dynamically stable. The
nearby 8:3 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter induces dynamical instability on
timescales 20 to 30 Myr. Hence, we conclude that P/2008 R1 has recently arrived
from a more stable source elsewhere. The high Tisserand parameter of the orbit
(in fact, with T_J = 3.216 it is the highest of any comet) points to a source
in the asteroid belt itself, instead of in the Kuiper belt (putative source of
the Jupiter family comets). We infer that P/2008 R1 is an icy body from the
outer asteroid belt in which sublimation has been triggered by rising
temperatures resulting from a decreasing perihelion distance."
"We study the influence of X-rays on the wind structure of selected O stars.
For this purpose we use our non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) wind
code with inclusion of additional artificial source of X-rays, assumed to
originate in the wind shocks.
  We show that the influence of shock X-ray emission on wind mass-loss rate is
relatively small. Wind terminal velocity may be slightly influenced by the
presence of strong X-ray sources, especially for stars cooler than Teff < 35
000 K.
  We discuss the origin of the Lx/L \sim 10^-7 relation. For stars with thick
wind this relation can be explained assuming that the cooling time depends on
wind density. Stars with optically thin winds exhibiting the ""weak wind
problem"" display enhanced X-ray emission which may be connected with large
shock cooling length. We propose that this effect can explain the ""weak wind
problem"".
  Inclusion of X-rays leads to a better agreement of the model ionization
structure with observations. However, we do not found any significant influence
of X-rays on Pv ionization fraction implying that the presence of X-rays cannot
explain the Pv problem.
  We study the implications of modified ionization equilibrium due to shock
emission on the line transfer in the X-ray region. We conclude that the X-ray
line profiles of helium-like ions may be affected by the line absorption within
the cool wind."
"The main findings of the european PHIL project (Polarised Helium to Image the
Lung) are reported. State of the art optical pumping techniques for polarising
^3He gas are described. MRI methodological improvements allow dynamical
ventilation images with a good resolution, ultimately limited by gas diffusion.
Diffusion imaging appears as a robust method of lung diagnosis. A discussion of
the potential advantage of low field MRI is presented. Selected PHIL results
for emphysema are given, with the perspectives that this joint work opens up
for the future of respiratory medicine."
"The directed and elliptic flow of protons and charged pions has been observed
from the semi-central collisions of a 158 GeV/nucleon Pb beam with a Pb target.
The rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the flow has been measured.
The directed flow of the pions is opposite to that of the protons but both
exhibit negative flow at low pt. The elliptic flow of both is fairly
independent of rapidity but rises with pt."
"We outline a method for fitting binary-lens caustic-crossing microlensing
events based on the alternative model parameterisation proposed and detailed in
Cassan (2008). As an illustration of our methodology, we present an analysis of
OGLE-2007-BLG-472, a double-peaked Galactic microlensing event with a source
crossing the whole caustic structure in less than three days. In order to
identify all possible models we conduct an extensive search of the parameter
space, followed by a refinement of the parameters with a Markov Chain-Monte
Carlo algorithm. We find a number of low-chi2 regions in the parameter space,
which lead to several distinct competitive best models. We examine the
parameters for each of them, and estimate their physical properties. We find
that our fitting strategy locates several minima that are difficult to find
with other modelling strategies and is therefore a more appropriate method to
fit this type of events."
"There are reasons to believe that implications of a certain paradox
introduced by Ginzburg and related problems have not been fully recognized.
Pertinent issues remain open and unresolved. There are instances when the
current widely used theory yields results having no physical meaning. As a
result, the current widely used theory is not equipped to cope with some of the
most fundamental problems in physics. In the present investigation, a new
formulation is proposed based on certain non-Maxwellian quantities which occur
whenever there is absorption. In the proposed formulation, the inconsistencies
and contradictions disclosed by the Ginzburg Paradox have been removed."
"Observations and simulations show that Mars' atmosphere has large seasonal
variations. Total atmospheric density can have an order of magnitude
latitudinal variation at exobase heights. By numerical simulations we show that
these latitude variations in exobase parameters induce asymmetries in the
hydrogen exosphere that propagate to large distances from the planet. We show
that these asymmetries in the exosphere produce asymmetries in the fluxes of
energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) and soft X-rays produced by charge exchange
between the solar wind and exospheric hydrogen. This could be an explanation
for asymmetries that have been observed in ENA and X-ray fluxes at Mars."
"Coupled human balancing tasks are investigated based on both pseudo-neural
controllers characterized by time-delayed feedback with random gain and natural
human balancing tasks. It is shown numerically that, compared to single
balancing tasks, balancing tasks coupled by mechanical structures exhibit
enhanced stability against balancing errors in terms of both amplitude and
velocity and also improve the tracking ability of the controllers. We then
perform an experiment in which numerical pseudo-neural controllers are replaced
with natural human balancing tasks carried out using computer mice. The results
reveal that the coupling structure generates asymmetric tracking abilities in
subjects whose tracking abilities are nearly symmetric in their single
balancing tasks."
"We have investigated a dependence of the relative density of phase slips in
the GPS navigation system on the disturbance level of the Earth's
magnetosphere. The study is based on using Internet-available selected data
from the global GPS network, with the simultaneously handled number of
receiving stations ranging from 160 to 323. The analysis used four days from
the period 1999-2000, with the values of the geomagnetic field disturbance
index Dst from 0 to -300 nT. During strong magnetic storms, the relative
density of phase slips on mid latitudes exceeds the one for magnetically quiet
days by one-two orders of magnitude as a minimum, and reaches a few and (for
some of the GPS satellites) even ten percent of the total density of
observations. Furthermore, the level of phase slips for the GPS satellites
located on the sunward side of the Earth was by a factor of 5-10 larger
compared with the opposite side of the Earth. The high positive correlation of
an increase in the density of phase slips and the intensity of ionospheric
irregularities during geomagnetic disturbances as detected in this study points
to the fact that the increase is slips is caused by the scattering of the GPS
signal from ionospheric irregularities."
"We investigate critical properties of a class of number-conserving cellular
automata (CA) which can be interpreted as deterministic models of traffic flow
with anticipatory driving. These rules are among the only known CA rules for
which the shape of the fundamental diagram has been rigorously derived. In
addition, their fundamental diagrams contain nonlinear segments, as opposed to
majority of number-conserving CA which exhibit piecewise-linear diagrams. We
found that the nature of singularities in the fundamental diagram of these
rules is the same as for rules with piecewise-linear diagrams. The current
converges toward its equilibrium value like $t^{-1/2}$, and the critical
exponent $\beta$ is equal to 1. This supports the conjecture of universal
behavior at singularities in number-conserving rules. We discuss properties of
phase transitions occurring at singularities as well as properties of the
intermediate phase."
"All existing quantum cryptosystems use non-orthogonal states as the carriers
of information. Non-orthogonal states cannot be cloned (duplicated) by an
eavesdropper. In result, any eavesdropping attempt must introduce errors in the
transmission, and therefore, can be detected by the legal users of the
communication channel. Orthogonal states are not used in quantum cryptography,
since they can be faithfully cloned without altering the transmitted data. In
this Letter we present a cryptographic scheme based on orthogonal states, which
also assures the detection of any eavesdropper."
"We derive nonstrange baryon-baryon scattering amplitudes in the
nonrelativistic quark model using the ``quark Born diagram"" formalism. This
approach describes the scattering as a single interaction, here the
one-gluon-exchange (OGE) spin-spin term followed by constituent interchange,
with external nonrelativistic baryon wavefunctions attached to the scattering
diagrams to incorporate higher-twist wavefunction effects. The short-range
repulsive core in the NN interaction has previously been attributed to this
spin-spin interaction in the literature; we find that these perturbative
constituent-interchange diagrams do indeed predict repulsive interactions in
all I,S channels of the nucleon-nucleon system, and we compare our results for
the equivalent short-range potentials to the core potentials found by other
authors using nonperturbative methods. We also apply our perturbative
techniques to the N$\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ systems: Some $\Delta\Delta$
channels are found to have attractive core potentials and may accommodate
``molecular"" bound states near threshold. Finally we use our Born formalism to
calculate the NN differential cross section, which we compare with experimental
results for unpolarised proton-proton elastic scattering. We find that several
familiar features of the experimental differential cross section are reproduced
by our Born-order result."
"Molecular chirality leads to a wonderful variety of equilibrium structures,
from the simple cholesteric phase to the twist-grain-boundary phases, and it is
responsible for interesting and technologically important materials like
ferroelectric liquid crystals. This paper will review some recent advances in
our understanding of the connection between the chiral geometry of individual
molecules and the important phenomenological parameters that determine
macroscopic chiral structure. It will then consider chiral structure in
columnar systems and propose a new equilibrium phase consisting of a regular
lattice of twisted ropes."
"We present the results of a molecular dynamics computer simulation in which
we investigate the dynamics of silica. By considering different system sizes,
we show that in simulations of the dynamics of this strong glass former
surprisingly large finite size effects are present. In particular we
demonstrate that the relaxation times of the incoherent intermediate scattering
function and the time dependence of the mean squared displacement are affected
by such finite size effects. By compressing the system to high densities, we
transform it to a fragile glass former and find that for that system these
types of finite size effects are much weaker."
"An electron diffraction technique is used to study the structure of clusters
formed in an isentropically expanding supersonic argon jet. The formation of
the hcp phase with increasing cluster size is reliably detected for the first
time. Observations are made for mean cluster sizes N in the range from 1x10^3
to 8x10^4 atoms/cluster. An analysis of the shape of the diffraction peaks is
carried out. It is found that in the range N <= 2x10^3 atoms/cluster, where the
clusters are icosahedral, the profiles of the diffraction peaks are well
approximated by a Lorentzian. For fcc clusters with N >= 3x10^3 atoms/cluster a
better approximation is the standard Gaussian function. In the case N >= 1x10^4
atoms/cluster one observes peaks of the hcp phase in addition to the fcc peaks.
The intensity of the hcp peaks increases with increasing cluster size, and for
N = 8x10^4 atoms/cluster, the (110), (101), (103), and (202) peaks,
characteristic only for the hcp phase, are clearly registered in addition to
the fcc peaks. A possible mechanism for the formation of the hcp structure in
Ar clusters is proposed."
"The adsorption of two kinds of porphyrin (Cu-TBPP) and perylene (PTCDA)
derived organic molecules deposited on KBr and Al2O3 surfaces has been studied
by non-contact force microscopy in ultra-high vacuum, our goal being the
assembly of ordered molecular arrangements on insulating surfaces at room
temperature. On a Cu(100) surface, well ordered islands of Cu-TBPP molecules
were successfully imaged. On KBr and Al2O3 surfaces, it was found that the same
molecules aggregate in small clusters at step edges, rather than forming
ordered monolayers. First measurements with PTCDA on KBr show that
nanometre-scale rectangular pits in the surface can act as traps to confine
small molecular assemblies."
"We study the conformational equilibria of two peptides using a novel
statistical mechanics approach designed for calculating free energy differences
between highly dis-similar conformational states. Our results elucidate the
contrasting roles of entropy in implicitly solvated leucine dipeptide and
decaglycine. The method extends earlier work by Voter, and overcomes the
notorious ""overlap"" problem in free energy computations by constructing a
mathematically equivalent calculation with high conformational similarity. The
approach requires only equilibrium simulations of the two states of interest,
without the need for sampling transition states. We discuss extensions of the
approach to binding affinity estimation and explicitly solvated systems, as
well as possible optimizations."
"A Poisson structure on the time-extended space R x M is shown to be
appropriate for a Hamiltonian formalism in which time is no more a privileged
variable and no a priori geometry is assumed on the space M of motions.
Possible geometries induced on the spatial domain M are investigated. An
abstract representation space for sl(2,R) algebra with a concrete physical
realization by the Darboux-Halphen system is considered for demonstration. The
Poisson bi-vector on R x M is shown to possess two intrinsic infinitesimal
automorphisms one of which is known as the modular or curl vector field.
Anchored to these two, an infinite hierarchy of automorphisms can be generated.
Implications on the symmetry structure of Hamiltonian dynamical systems are
discussed. As a generalization of the isomorphism between contact flows and
their symplectifications, the relation between Hamiltonian flows on R x M and
infinitesimal motions on M preserving a geometric structure therein is
demonstrated for volume preserving diffeomorphisms in connection with
three-dimensional motion of an incompressible fluid."
"Polarizabilities of Ge$_n$ clusters with 2 to 25 atoms are calculated using
coupled-perturbation Hartree-Fock (CPHF) and finite field (FF) method within
density functional theory. The polarizabilities of the Ge$_n$ clusters increase
rapidly in the size range of 2 to 5 atoms and then fluctuate around the bulk
value. The polarizabilities are sensitively dependent on the cluster geometries
and electronic structures. The large HOMO-LUMO gap may lead to the small
polarizability. As compared with the compact structure and diamond structure,
the prolate cluster structure corresponds to a larger polarizability."
"We introduce a matrix-operator formulation of the Anderson model in d=2. In a
single slice, we can then derive an analogy between our model and a standard
random matrices problem. This enables us to construct and control the Green
function in one slice, which is an important prerequisite to a full multi-scale
study of the problem using the Renormalisation Group approach."
"The angular momentum (partial wave) reduction of the Lippmann--Schwinger
equation describing the interaction of two spin 1/2 particles is extended to
the case in which the spin singlet and triplet states are coupled. A straight
forward method for obtaining the angular momentum decomposition of the general
potential is indicated. The derived formalism is needed to describe the
interaction between two nonidentical spin--1/2 particles or between two
nucleons when isospin symmetry is violated. The resulting modification of the
Stapp phase--shift analysis is given."
"This note deals with a multivariate stochastic approach to forecast the
behaviour of a cyclic time series. Particular attention is devoted to the
problem of the prediction of time behaviour of sunspot numbers for the current
23th cycle. The idea is to consider the previous known n cycles as n particular
realizations of a given stochastic process. The aim is to predict the future
behaviour of the current n+1th realization given a portion of the curve and the
structure of the previous n realizations. The model derived is based on the
cross-correlations between the current n+1th realization and the previous n
ones and the solution of the related least squares problem. As example we
applied the method to smoothed monthly sunspots numbers from SIDC archives, in
order to predict the behaviour of the current 23th solar cycle."
"The rotations of microscopic magnetic particles, magnetosomes, embedded into
the cytoskeleton are considered. A great number of magnetosomes are shown to
possess two stable equilibrium positions, between which there occur transitions
under the influence of thermal disturbances. The random rotations attain the
value of order of radian. The rate of the transitions and the probability of
magnetosomes to stay in the different states depend on magnetic field direction
with respect to an averaged magnetosome's orientation. This effect explains the
ability of migrant birds to faultless orientation in long-term passages in the
absence of the direct visibility of optical reference points. The sensitivity
to deviation from an `ideal' orientation is estimated to be 1-2 degrees.
Possible participation of magnetosomes in biological effects caused by
microwave electromagnetic fields is discussed."
"We present a class of models in which the top quark, by mixing with new
physics at a higher energy scale, is naturally heavier than the other standard
model particles. We take this new physics to be extended color. Our models
contain new particles with masses between 100 GeV and 1 TeV, some of which may
be just within the reach of the next generation of experiments. In particular
one of our models implies the existence of two right handed top quarks. These
models demonstrate the existence of a standard model-like theory consistent
with experiment, and leading to new physics below the TeV scale, in which the
third generation is treated differently than the first two."
"We modified the recently proposed multicanonical MC algorithm for the case of
a magnetic field driven order--order phase transition. We test this {\it
multimagnetic} Monte Carlo algorithm for the D=2 Ising model at $\beta=0.5$ and
simulate square lattices up to size $100 \times 100$. On these lattices with
periodic boundary conditions it is possible to enhance the appearance of
order-order interfaces during the simulation by many orders of magnitude as
compared to the standard Monte Carlo simulation."
"Cross section fluctuations in nuclear scattering are briefly reviewed in
order to show the main important features. Then chaotic scattering is
introduced by means of a very simple model. It is shown that chaoticity
produces the same kind of irregular fluctuations observed in light heavy--ion
collisions. The transition from order to chaos allows a new general framework
for a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms."
"At the recent 1999 World Athletics Championships in Sevilla, Spain, Canada's
Bruny Surin matched Donovan Bailey's National and former World Record 100 m
mark of 9.84 s. The unofficial times for each, as read from the photo-finish,
were 9.833 s and 9.835 s respectively. Who, then, is the fastest Canadian of
all time? A possible solution is offered, accounting for drag effects resulting
from ambient tail-winds and altitude."
"Resolution enhancements are often desired in imaging applications where
high-resolution sensor arrays are difficult to obtain. Many computational
imaging methods have been proposed to encode high-resolution scene information
on low-resolution sensors by cleverly modulating light from the scene before it
hits the sensor. These methods often require movement of some portion of the
imaging apparatus or only acquire images up to the resolution of a modulating
element. Here a technique is presented for resolving beyond the resolutions of
both a pointwise-modulating mask element and a sensor array through the
introduction of a controlled blur into the optical pathway. The analysis
contains an intuitive and exact expression for the overall superresolvability
of the system, and arguments are presented to explain how the combination of
random coding and blurring makes the superresolution problem well-posed.
Experimental results demonstrate that a resolution enhancement of approximately
$4\times$ is possible in practice using standard optical components, without
mechanical motion of the imaging apparatus, and without any a priori
assumptions on scene structure."
"Many real networks are complex and have power-law vertex degree distribution,
short diameter, and high clustering. We analyze the network model based on
thresholding of the summed vertex weights, which belongs to the class of
networks proposed by Caldarelli et al. (2002). Power-law degree distributions,
particularly with the dynamically stable scaling exponent 2, realistic
clustering, and short path lengths are produced for many types of weight
distributions. Thresholding mechanisms can underlie a family of real complex
networks that is characterized by cooperativeness and the baseline scaling
exponent 2. It contrasts with the class of growth models with preferential
attachment, which is marked by competitiveness and baseline scaling exponent 3."
