Abstract
"The ongoing trend to move industrial appliances from previously isolated
networks to the Internet requires fundamental changes in security to uphold
secure and safe operation. Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure
communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g.,
Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g.,
MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes
indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using
TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices,
we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols
covering the complete IPv4 address space.
  Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly
developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find
that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols
(7.2% vs. 0.4%), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5% of hosts).
Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to
the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42% of hosts with TLS support
(26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally,
we show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration
templates, is promising to strengthen security."
"Context: Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics is aimed at protecting networks,
computers, and data from unauthorized access by analysing security event data
using big data tools and technologies. Whilst a plethora of Big Data
Cybersecurity Analytic Systems have been reported in the literature, there is a
lack of a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature from an
architectural perspective. Objective: This paper reports a systematic review
aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and
architectural tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems. Method: We
used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 primary studies
selected using well-defined criteria. Results: Our findings are twofold: (i)
identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes and the
justification for their significance for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic
Systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics
for addressing the quality attributes that are commonly associated with Big
Data Cybersecurity Analytic systems. The identified tactics include six
performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three
reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each. Conclusion:
Our findings have revealed that (a) despite the significance of
interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and
privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support
in the literature (b) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the
impact of codified architectural tactics (c) a good deal of research effort
should be invested to explore the trade-offs and dependencies among the
identified tactics and (d) there is a general lack of effective collaboration
between academia and industry for supporting the field of Big Data
Cybersecurity Analytic Systems."
"As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment continues to be
integrated into power systems, issues related to cybersecurity are increasingly
emerging. Particularly noteworthy is the transition to digital substations,
which is shifting operations from traditional hardwired-based systems to
communication-based Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system
operations. These changes in the power system have increased the vulnerability
of the system to cyber-attacks and emphasized its importance. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML) based post event analysis of the power system
in order to respond to these cybersecurity issues. An artificial neural network
(ANN) and other ML models are trained using transient fault measurements and
cyber-attack data on substations. The trained models can successfully
distinguish between power system faults and cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the
results of the proposed ML-based methods can also identify 10 different fault
types and the location where the event occurred."
"Cybersecurity is now at the forefront of most organisational digital
transformative agendas and National economic, social and political programmes.
Hence its impact to society can no longer be seen to be one dimensional. The
rise in National cybersecurity laws and regulations is a good indicator of its
perceived importance to nations. And the recent awakening for social and
ethical transparency in society and coupled with sustainability issues
demonstrate the need for a paradigm shift in how cybersecurity discourses can
now happen. In response to this shift, a multidimensional cybersecurity
framework for strategic foresight underpinned on situational awareness is
proposed. The conceptual cybersecurity framework comprising six domains such as
Physical, Cultural, Economic, Social, Political and Cyber, is discussed. The
guiding principles underpinning the framework are outlined, followed by
in-depth reflection on the Business, Operational, Technological and Human
(BOTH) factors and their implications for strategic foresight for
cybersecurity."
"Blockchain technology enables stakeholders to conduct trusted data sharing
and exchange without a trusted centralized institution. These features make
blockchain applications attractive to enhance trustworthiness in very different
contexts. Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain
has become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years.
Every participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by
cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special
incentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined
native cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain.
In many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction
throughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world.
A permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that
do not establish an entire trust relationship. Unlike permissionless
blockchains, the participants must be identified in permissioned blockchains.
By relying on the traditional crash fault-tolerant consensus protocols,
permissioned blockchains can achieve high transaction throughput and low
latency without sacrificing security. However, how to balance the security and
consensus efficiency is still the issue that needs to be solved urgently in
permissioned blockchains. As the core module of blockchain technology, the
consensus algorithm plays a vital role in the performance of the blockchain
system. Thus, this paper proposes a new consensus algorithm for permissioned
blockchain, the Risk Assessment-based Consensus protocol (RAC), combined with
the decentralized design concept and the risk-node assessment mechanism to
address the unbalance issues of performance in speed, scalability, and
security."
"With the turmoil in cybersecurity and the mind-blowing advances in AI, it is
only natural that cybersecurity practitioners consider further employing
learning techniques to help secure their organizations and improve the
efficiency of their security operation centers. But with great fears come great
opportunities for both the good and the evil, and a myriad of bad deals. This
paper discusses ten issues in cybersecurity that hopefully will make it easier
for practitioners to ask detailed questions about what they want from an AI
system in their cybersecurity operations. We draw on the state of the art to
provide factual arguments for a discussion on well-established AI in
cybersecurity issues, including the current scope of AI and its application to
cybersecurity, the impact of privacy concerns on the cybersecurity data that
can be collected and shared externally to the organization, how an AI decision
can be explained to the person running the operations center, and the
implications of the adversarial nature of cybersecurity in the learning
techniques. We then discuss the use of AI by attackers on a level playing field
including several issues in an AI battlefield, and an AI perspective on the old
cat-and-mouse game including how the adversary may assess your AI power."
"The current world challenges include issues such as infectious disease
pandemics, environmental health risks, food safety, and crime prevention.
Through this article, a special emphasis is given to one of the main challenges
in the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cyber risk. Since
the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has
detected a dramatic increase in the number of cyber-attacks. For instance, in
Italy the COVID-19 emergency has heavily affected cybersecurity; from January
to April 2020, the total of attacks, accidents, and violations of privacy to
the detriment of companies and individuals has doubled. Using a systematic and
rigorous approach, this paper aims to analyze the literature on the cyber risk
in the healthcare sector to understand the real knowledge on this topic. The
findings highlight the poor attention of the scientific community on this
topic, except in the United States. The literature lacks research contributions
to support cyber risk management in subject areas such as Business, Management
and Accounting; Social Science; and Mathematics. This research outlines the
need to empirically investigate the cyber risk, giving a practical solution to
health facilities. Keywords: cyber risk; cyber-attack; cybersecurity; computer
security; COVID-19; coronavirus;information technology risk; risk management;

"The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is detrimental to businesses
and individuals as we are heavily relying on the Internet. Due to remarkable
profits, crackers favor DDoS as cybersecurity weapons in attacking servers,
computers, IoT devices, and even the entire Internet. Many current detection
and mitigation solutions concentrate on specific technologies in combating
DDoS, whereas the attacking expense and the cross-defender collaboration have
not drawn enough attention. Under this circumstance, we revisit the DDoS attack
and defense in terms of attacking cost and populations of both parties,
proposing a joint defense framework to incur higher attacking expense in a grid
of Internet service providers (ISPs), businesses, individuals, and third-party
organizations (IoT Grid). Meanwhile, the defender's cost does not grow much
during combats. The skyrocket of attacking expense discourages profit-driven
attackers from launching further attacks effectively. The quantitative
evaluation and experimental assessment reinforce the effectiveness of our
framework."
"Today, deep learning represents the most popular and successful form of
machine learning. Deep learning has revolutionised the field of pattern
recognition, including biometric recognition. Biometric systems utilising deep
learning have been shown to achieve auspicious recognition accuracy, surpassing
human performance. Apart from said breakthrough advances in terms of biometric
performance, the use of deep learning was reported to impact different
covariates of biometrics such as algorithmic fairness, vulnerability to
attacks, or template protection. Technologies of biometric template protection
are designed to enable a secure and privacy-preserving deployment of
biometrics. In the recent past, deep learning techniques have been frequently
applied in biometric template protection systems for various purposes. This
work provides an overview of how advances in deep learning take influence on
the field of biometric template protection. The interrelation between improved
biometric performance rates and security in biometric template protection is
elaborated. Further, the use of deep learning for obtaining feature
representations that are suitable for biometric template protection is
discussed. Novel methods that apply deep learning to achieve various goals of
biometric template protection are surveyed along with deep learning-based
attacks."
"Technology has advanced dramatically in the previous several years. There are
also cyber assaults. Cyberattacks pose a possible danger to information
security and the general public. Since data practice and internet consumption
rates continue to upswing, cyber awareness has become progressively important.
Furthermore, as businesses pace their digital transformation with mobile
devices, cloud services, communal media, and Internet of Things services,
cybersecurity has appeared as a critical issue in corporate risk management.
This research focuses on the relations between cybersecurity awareness, cyber
knowledge, computer ethics, cyber ethics, and cyber behavior, as well as
protective tools, across university students in general. The findings express
that while internet users are alert of cyber threats, they only take the most
elementary and easy-to-implement precautions. Several knowledge and awareness
have been proposed to knob the issue of cyber security. It also grants the
principles of cybersecurity in terms of its structure, workforces, and evidence
pertaining to the shield of personal information in the cyber world. The first
step is for people to educate themselves about the negative aspects of the
internet and to learn more about cyber threats so that they can notice when an
attack is taking place. To validate the efficiency of the suggested analysis
between CS and non-CS university students, case study along with several
comparisons are provided."
"The continuous rise in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Internet
of Things (IoT) by businesses has brought unprecedented opportunities for
innovation and growth. However, due to the distinct characteristics of these
emerging IoT technologies like real-time data processing, Self-configuration,
interoperability, and scalability, they have also introduced some unique
cybersecurity challenges, such as malware attacks, advanced persistent threats
(APTs), DoS /DDoS (Denial of Service & Distributed Denial of Service attacks)
and insider threats. As a result of these challenges, there is an increased
need for improved cybersecurity approaches and efficient management solutions
to ensure the privacy and security of communication within IoT networks. One
proposed security approach is the utilization of trust-based systems and is the
focus of this study. This research paper presents a systematic literature
review on the Trust-based cybersecurity security approaches for IoT. A total of
23 articles were identified that satisfy the review criteria. We highlighted
the common trust-based mitigation techniques in existence for dealing with
these threats and grouped them into three major categories, namely:
Observation-Based, Knowledge-Based & Cluster-Based systems. Finally, several
open issues were highlighted, and future research directions presented."
"Spear Phishing is a type of cyber-attack where the attacker sends hyperlinks
through email on well-researched targets. The objective is to obtain sensitive
information by imitating oneself as a trustworthy website. In recent times,
deep learning has become the standard for defending against such attacks.
However, these architectures were designed with only defense in mind. Moreover,
the attacker's perspective and motivation are absent while creating such
models. To address this, we need a game-theoretic approach to understand the
perspective of the attacker (Hacker) and the defender (Phishing URL detector).
We propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with novel training
strategy for real-time phishing URL detection. Additionally, we train our
architecture in a semi-supervised manner to distinguish between adversarial and
real examples, along with detecting malicious and benign URLs. We also design
two games between the attacker and defender in training and deployment settings
by utilizing the game-theoretic perspective. Our experiments confirm that the
proposed architecture surpasses recent state-of-the-art architectures for
phishing URLs detection."
"As the Internet of Things (IoT) has become truly ubiquitous, so has the
surrounding threat landscape. However, while the security of classical
computing systems has significantly matured in the last decades, IoT
cybersecurity is still typically low or fully neglected. This paper provides a
classification of IoT malware. Major targets and used exploits for attacks are
identified and referred to the specific malware. The lack of standard
definitions of IoT devices and, therefore, security goals has been identified
during this research as a profound barrier in advancing IoT cybersecurity.
Furthermore, standardized reporting of IoT malware by trustworthy sources is
required in the field. The majority of current IoT attacks continue to be of
comparably low effort and level of sophistication and could be mitigated by
existing technical measures."
"Cyber threats affect all kinds of organisations. Risk analysis is an
essential methodology for cybersecurity as it allows organisations to deal with
the cyber threats potentially affecting them, prioritise the defence of their
assets and decide what security controls should be implemented. Many risk
analysis methods are present in cybersecurity models, compliance frameworks and
international standards. However, most of them employ risk matrices, which
suffer shortcomings that may lead to suboptimal resource allocations. We
propose a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity risk analysis, covering the
presence of both adversarial and non-intentional threats and the use of
insurance as part of the security portfolio. A case study illustrating the
proposed framework is presented, serving as template for more complex cases."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is intended for ubiquitous connectivity among
different entities or ""things"". While its purpose is to provide effective and
efficient solutions, security of the devices and network is a challenging
issue. The number of devices connected along with the ad-hoc nature of the
system further exacerbates the situation. Therefore, security and privacy has
emerged as a significant challenge for the IoT. In this paper,we aim to provide
a thorough survey related to the privacy and security challenges of the IoT.
This document addresses these challenges from the perspective of technologies
and architecture used. This work focuses also in IoT intrinsic vulnerabilities
as well as the security challenges of various layers based on the security
principles of data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This survey
analyzes articles published for the IoT at the time and relates it to the
security conjuncture of the field and its projection to the future."
"Training the future cybersecurity workforce to respond to emerging threats
requires introduction of novel educational interventions into the cybersecurity
curriculum. To be effective, these interventions have to incorporate trending
knowledge from cybersecurity and other related domains while allowing for
experiential learning through hands-on experimentation. To date, the
traditional interdisciplinary approach for cybersecurity training has infused
political science, law, economics or linguistics knowledge into the
cybersecurity curriculum, allowing for limited experimentation. Cybersecurity
students were left with little opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and
abilities in domains outside of these. Also, students in outside majors had no
options to get into cybersecurity. With this in mind, we developed an
interdisciplinary course for experiential learning in the fields of
cybersecurity and interaction design. The inaugural course teaches students
from cybersecurity, user interaction design, and visual design the principles
of designing for secure use - or secure design - and allows them to apply them
for prototyping of Internet-of-Things (IoT) products for smart homes. This
paper elaborates on the concepts of secure design and how our approach enhances
the training of the future cybersecurity workforce."
"The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are pivotal information for
proactive cybersecurity measures, including service patching, security
hardening, and more. However, CVEs typically offer low-level, product-oriented
descriptions of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, often lacking
the essential attack semantic information required for comprehensive weakness
characterization and threat impact estimation. This critical insight is
essential for CVE prioritization and the identification of potential
countermeasures, particularly when dealing with a large number of CVEs. Current
industry practices involve manual evaluation of CVEs to assess their attack
severities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and mapping
them to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for potential mitigation
identification. Unfortunately, this manual analysis presents a major bottleneck
in the vulnerability analysis process, leading to slowdowns in proactive
cybersecurity efforts and the potential for inaccuracies due to human errors.
In this research, we introduce our novel predictive model and tool (called
CVEDrill) which revolutionizes CVE analysis and threat prioritization. CVEDrill
accurately estimates the CVSS vector for precise threat mitigation and priority
ranking and seamlessly automates the classification of CVEs into the
appropriate CWE hierarchy classes. By harnessing CVEDrill, organizations can
now implement cybersecurity countermeasure mitigation with unparalleled
accuracy and timeliness, surpassing in this domain the capabilities of
state-of-the-art tools like ChaptGPT."
"Digital forensic investigation is a complex and time-consuming activity in
response to a cybersecurity incident or cybercrime to answer questions related
to it. These typically are what happened, when, where, how, and who is
responsible. However, answering them is often very laborious and sometimes
outright impossible due to a lack of useable data. The forensic-ready software
systems are designed to produce valuable on-point data for use in the
investigation with potentially high evidence value. Still, the particular ways
to develop these systems are currently not explored.
  This paper proposes consideration of forensic readiness within security risk
management to refine specific requirements on forensic-ready software systems.
The idea is to re-evaluate the taken security risk decisions with the aim to
provide trustable data when the security measures fail. Additionally, it also
considers possible disputes, which the digital evidence can solve. Our proposed
approach, risk-oriented forensic-ready design, composes of two parts: (1)
process guiding the identification of the requirements in the form of potential
evidence sources, and (2) supporting BPMN notation capturing the potential
evidence sources and their relationship. Together they are aimed to provide a
high-level overview of the forensic-ready requirements within the system.
Finally, the approach is demonstrated on an automated valet parking scenario,
followed by a discussion regarding its impact and usefulness within the
forensic readiness effort."
"There is no denying that the use of Information Technology (IT) is undergoing
exponential growth in today's world. This digital transformation has also given
rise to a multitude of security challenges, notably in the realm of cybercrime.
In response to these growing threats, public and private sectors have
prioritized the strengthening of IT security measures. In light of the growing
security concern, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained prominence within the
cybersecurity landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent
advancements in AI-driven threat response systems. To the best of our
knowledge, the most recent survey covering the AI reaction domain was conducted
in 2017. Since then, considerable literature has been published and therefore
it is worth reviewing it. By means of several shared features, each of the
studies is compared on a common ground. Through an analysis of the research
papers conducted on a standardized basis, this survey aims to unravel the
complexities and opportunities of integrating AI into cyber defense. The
conclusions drawn from this collective analysis provide a comprehensive
snapshot of the evolving landscape at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.
This landscape underscores the growing significance of not only anticipating
and detecting threats but also responding to them effectively. Additionally,
from these reviews, various research challenges for the future are presented.
These challenges serve as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in the
field of AI-integrated reactive strategies."
"BANZKP is the best to date Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based secure
lightweight and energy efficient authentication scheme designed for Wireless
Area Network (WBAN). It is vulnerable to several security attacks such as the
replay attack, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at sink and
redundancy information crack. However, BANZKP needs an end-to-end
authentication which is not compliant with the human body postural mobility. We
propose a new scheme BAN-GZKP. Our scheme improves both the security and
postural mobility resilience of BANZKP. Moreover, BAN-GZKP uses only a
three-phase authentication which is optimal in the class of ZKP protocols. To
fix the security vulnerabilities of BANZKP, BAN-GZKP uses a novel random key
allocation and a Hop-by-Hop authentication definition. We further prove the
reliability of our scheme to various attacks including those to which BANZKP is
vulnerable. Furthermore, via extensive simulations we prove that our scheme,
BAN-GZKP, outperforms BANZKP in terms of reliability to human body postural
mobility for various network parameters (end-to-end delay, number of packets
exchanged in the network, number of transmissions). We compared both schemes
using representative convergecast strategies with various transmission rates
and human postural mobility. Finally, it is important to mention that BAN-GZKP
has no additional cost compared to BANZKP in terms memory, computational
complexity or energy consumption."
"In this article, we provide a summary of recent efforts towards achieving
Internet geolocation securely, \ie without allowing the entity being geolocated
to cheat about its own geographic location. Cheating motivations arise from
many factors, including impersonation (in the case locations are used to
reinforce authentication), and gaining location-dependent benefits. In
particular, we provide a technical overview of Client Presence Verification
(CPV) and Server Location Verification (SLV)---two recently proposed techniques
designed to verify the geographic locations of clients and servers in realtime
over the Internet. Each technique addresses a wide range of adversarial tactics
to manipulate geolocation, including the use of IP-hiding technologies like
VPNs and anonymizers, as we now explain."
"Due to the increasing connectivity of modern vehicles, collected data is no
longer only stored in the vehicle itself but also transmitted to car
manufacturers and vehicle assistant apps. This development opens up new
possibilities for digital forensics in criminal investigations involving modern
vehicles. This paper deals with the digital forensic analysis of vehicle
assistant apps of eight car manufacturers. We reconstruct the driver's
activities based on the data stored on the smartphones and in the
manufacturer's backend.
  For this purpose, data of the Android and iOS apps of the car manufacturers
Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes, Opel, Seat, Tesla, and Volkswagen were extracted
from the smartphone and examined using digital forensic methods in accordance
with lawful government-approved forensics guidelines. Additionally,
manufacturer data was retrieved using Subject Access Requests. Using the
extensive data gathered, we successfully reconstruct trips and refueling
processes, determine parking positions and duration, and track the locking and
unlocking of the vehicle.
  These findings show that the digital forensic investigation of smartphone
applications is a useful addition to vehicle forensics and should therefore be
taken into account in the strategic preparation of future digital forensic
investigations."
"Cybersecurity is increasingly a concern for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), and there exist many awareness training programs and tools
for them. The literature mainly studies SMEs as a unitary type of company and
provides one-size-fits-all recommendations and solutions. However, SMEs are not
homogeneous. They are diverse with different vulnerabilities, cybersecurity
needs, and competencies. Few studies considered such differences in standards
and certificates for security tools adoption and cybersecurity tailoring for
these SMEs. This study proposes a classification framework with an outline of
cybersecurity improvement needs for each class. The framework suggests five SME
types based on their characteristics and specific security needs: cybersecurity
abandoned SME, unskilled SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and
cybersecurity provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the
study explains the framework's usage in sampled SMEs. The framework proposes
solutions for each class to approach cybersecurity awareness and competence
more consistent with SME needs. The final publication is available at ACM
Digital Library via this https URL https://doi.org/10.1145/3465481.3469200"
"The mobile device is one of the fasted growing technologies that is widely
used in a diversifying sector. Mobile devices are used for everyday life, such
as personal information exchange - chatting, email, shopping, and mobile
banking, contributing to information security threats. Users' behavior can
influence information security threats. More research is needed to understand
users' threat avoidance behavior and motivation. Using Technology threat
avoidance theory (TTAT), this study assessed factors that influenced mobile
device users' threat avoidance motivations and behaviors as it relates to
phishing attacks. From the data collected from 137 mobile device users using a
questionnaire, the findings indicate that (1) mobile device users' perceived
susceptibility and severity of phishing attacks have a significant correlation
with a users' perception of the threat; (2) mobile device users' motivation to
avoid a threat is correlated to a users' behavior in avoiding threat; and (3) a
mobile device user's susceptibility to phishing attacks can be reduced by their
perception of the threat. These findings reveal that a user's perception of
threat increases if they perceive that the consequence of such threat to their
mobile devices will be severe, thereby increasing a user's motivation and
behavior to avoid phishing attack threats. This study is beneficial to mobile
device users in personal and organizational settings."
"The last decades have been characterized by unprecedented technological
advances, many of them powered by modern technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The world has become more
digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most
significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments,
businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies
combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a
complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in
demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep
learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect
our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based
classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network
intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network
security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the
challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions
into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to
overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research
directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern
digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems."
"Cyber threats are increasing not only in their volume but also in their
sophistication and difficulty to detect. Attacks have become a national/global
threat as they have targeted private and public, as well as government sectors
over the years. This is a growing issue and organisations are taking steps to
reduce, detect and prevent threats. To do this they need to use systems that
are equipped with the capabilities to do either of those steps and develop them
for the type of networks they use, for instance wired or wireless. One of these
systems are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which can be used as the first
defence mechanism or a secondary defence mechanism of a threat or an attack.
There are different types of attacks that can occur in a network, such as
Denial of service (DoS)/Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), port scanning,
malware or ransomware and so forth that IDSs have a capability of detecting.
Assisting in the mitigation of such attacks, there are also Intrusion
Prevention Systems (IPS) whose role has a different purpose than that of IDSs.
Unlike IDSs they not only detect threats but prevent them from disrupting the
network, IPSs can be used in conjunction with IDSs to double the defences. This
paper provides an overview of IDS and their classifications and IPS. It will
detail typical benefits and limitations to using IDSs, IPSs and the hybrids
(such as Intrusions Detection Prevention Systems (IDPSs and more)) which will
be discussed further. It will also outline developments in the making using ML
and how it is used to improve these systems and the dilemmas they produce and
possible ways to counter act them."
"The Internet and cyberspace are inseparable aspects of everyone's life.
Cyberspace is a concept that describes widespread, interconnected, and online
digital technology. Cyberspace refers to the online world that is separate from
everyday reality. Since the internet is a recent advance in human lives, there
are many unknown and unpredictable aspects to it that sometimes can be
catastrophic to users in financial aspects, high-tech industry, and healthcare.
Cybersecurity failures are usually caused by human errors or their lack of
knowledge. According to the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
X-Force Threat Intelligence Index in 2020, around 8.5 billion records were
compromised in 2019 due to failures of insiders, which is an increase of more
than 200 percent compared to the compromised records in 2018. In another survey
performed by the Ernst and Young Global Information Security during 2018-2019,
it is reported that 34% of the organizations stated that employees who are
inattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal
vulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that
phishing is the main threat to them. Inattentive users are one of the reasons
for data breaches and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
in the United Kingdom observed that 23.2 million users who were victims of
cybersecurity attacks used a carelessly selected password, which is 123456, as
their account password. The Annual Cybersecurity Report published by Cisco in
2018 announced that phishing and spear phishing emails are the root causes of
many cybersecurity attacks in recent years. Hence, enhancing the cybersecurity
behaviors of both personal users and organizations can protect vulnerable users
from cyber threats. Both human factors and technological aspects of
cybersecurity should be addressed in organizations for a safer environment."
"Malware detection is a critical aspect of information security. One
difficulty that arises is that malware often evolves over time. To maintain
effective malware detection, it is necessary to determine when malware
evolution has occurred so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. We
perform a variety of experiments aimed at detecting points in time where a
malware family has likely evolved, and we consider secondary tests designed to
confirm that evolution has actually occurred. Several malware families are
analyzed, each of which includes a number of samples collected over an extended
period of time. Our experiments indicate that improved results are obtained
using feature engineering based on word embedding techniques. All of our
experiments are based on machine learning models, and hence our evolution
detection strategies require minimal human intervention and can easily be
automated."
"In this paper we focus on one part of the trust infrastructures needed for
the future virtual assets industry, namely the attestation infrastructure
related to key management in private wallet systems. Our focus is on regulated
private wallets utilizing trusted hardware, and the capability of the wallet to
yield attestation evidence suitable to address requirements in several
use-cases, such as asset insurance and regulatory compliance. We argue that
attestation services will be needed as a core part of the key management
lifecycle for private wallets in true decentralized systems."
"The cybersecurity threat landscape has lately become overly complex. Threat
actors leverage weaknesses in the network and endpoint security in a very
coordinated manner to perpetuate sophisticated attacks that could bring down
the entire network and many critical hosts in the network. Increasingly
advanced deep and machine learning-based solutions have been used in threat
detection and protection. The application of these techniques has been reviewed
well in the scientific literature. Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown great
promise in developing AI-based solutions for areas that had earlier required
advanced human cognizance. Different techniques and algorithms under deep
reinforcement learning have shown great promise in applications ranging from
games to industrial processes, where it is claimed to augment systems with
general AI capabilities. These algorithms have recently also been used in
cybersecurity, especially in threat detection and endpoint protection, where
these are showing state-of-the-art results. Unlike supervised machines and deep
learning, deep reinforcement learning is used in more diverse ways and is
empowering many innovative applications in the threat defense landscape.
However, there does not exist any comprehensive review of these unique
applications and accomplishments. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to fill
this gap and provide a comprehensive review of the different applications of
deep reinforcement learning in cybersecurity threat detection and protection."

models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and
capability, it's critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity
perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI
tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing
on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This
research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and
opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work
presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious
users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on
the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks,
reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also
investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber
attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to
create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack
payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then
examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures,
including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code
generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines,
incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the
social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper
highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure,
safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity
impacts."
"Governments around the world are required to strengthen their national
cybersecurity capabilities to respond effectively to the growing, changing, and
sophisticated cyber threats and attacks, thus protecting society and the way of
life as a whole. Responsible government institutions need to revise, evaluate,
and bolster their national cybersecurity capabilities to fulfill the new
requirements, for example regarding new trends affecting cybersecurity, key
supporting laws and regulations, and implementations risk and challenges. This
report presents a comprehensive assessment instrument for cybersecurity at the
national level in order to help countries to ensure optimum response capability
and more effective use of critical resources of each state. More precisely, the
report - builds a common understanding of the critical cybersecurity
capabilities and competence to be assessed at the national level, - adds value
to national strategic planning and implementation which impact the development
and adaptation of national cybersecurity strategies, - provides an overview of
the assessment approaches at the national level, including capabilities,
frameworks, and controls, - introduces a comprehensive cybersecurity instrument
for countries to determine areas of improvement and develop enduring national
capabilities, - describes how to apply the proposed national cybersecurity
assessment framework in a real-world case, and - presents the results and
lessons learned of the application of the assessment framework at the national
level to assist governments in further building cybersecurity capabilities."
"With the advent of the digital era, every day-to-day task is automated due to
technological advances. However, technology has yet to provide people with
enough tools and safeguards. As the internet connects more-and-more devices
around the globe, the question of securing the connected devices grows at an
even spiral rate. Data thefts, identity thefts, fraudulent transactions,
password compromises, and system breaches are becoming regular everyday news.
The surging menace of cyber-attacks got a jolt from the recent advancements in
Artificial Intelligence. AI is being applied in almost every field of different
sciences and engineering. The intervention of AI not only automates a
particular task but also improves efficiency by many folds. So it is evident
that such a scrumptious spread would be very appetizing to cybercriminals. Thus
the conventional cyber threats and attacks are now ``intelligent"" threats. This
article discusses cybersecurity and cyber threats along with both conventional
and intelligent ways of defense against cyber-attacks. Furthermore finally, end
the discussion with the potential prospects of the future of AI in
cybersecurity."
"During the last two decades, distributed energy systems, especially renewable
energy sources (RES), have become more economically viable with increasing
market share and penetration levels on power systems. In addition to
decarbonization and decentralization of energy systems, digitalization has also
become very important. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), advanced
optimization algorithms, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and other
digitalization frameworks makes modern power system assets more intelligent,
while vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. This paper proposes the concept of the
Internet of Predictable Things (IoPT) that incorporates advanced data analytics
and machine learning methods to increase the resiliency of cyber-physical
systems against cybersecurity risks. The proposed concept is demonstrated using
a cyber-physical system testbed under a variety of cyber attack scenarios as a
proof of concept (PoC)."
"Adversary thinking is an essential skill for cybersecurity experts, enabling
them to understand cyber attacks and set up effective defenses. While this
skill is commonly exercised by Capture the Flag games and hands-on activities,
we complement these approaches with a key innovation: undergraduate students
learn methods of network attack and defense by creating educational games in a
cyber range. In this paper, we present the design of two courses, instruction
and assessment techniques, as well as our observations over the last three
semesters. The students report they had a unique opportunity to deeply
understand the topic and practice their soft skills, as they presented their
results at a faculty open day event. Their peers, who played the created games,
rated the quality and educational value of the games overwhelmingly positively.
Moreover, the open day raised awareness about cybersecurity and research and
development in this field at our faculty. We believe that sharing our teaching
experience will be valuable for instructors planning to introduce active
learning of cybersecurity and adversary thinking."
"Social engineering cyberattacks are a major threat because they often prelude
sophisticated and devastating cyberattacks. Social engineering cyberattacks are
a kind of psychological attack that exploits weaknesses in human cognitive
functions. Adequate defense against social engineering cyberattacks requires a
deeper understanding of what aspects of human cognition are exploited by these
cyberattacks, why humans are susceptible to these cyberattacks, and how we can
minimize or at least mitigate their damage. These questions have received some
amount of attention but the state-of-the-art understanding is superficial and
scattered in the literature. In this paper, we review human cognition through
the lens of social engineering cyberattacks. Then, we propose an extended
framework of human cognitive functions to accommodate social engineering
cyberattacks. We cast existing studies on various aspects of social engineering
cyberattacks into the extended framework, while drawing a number of insights
that represent the current understanding and shed light on future research
directions. The extended framework might inspire future research endeavors
towards a new sub-field that can be called Cybersecurity Cognitive Psychology,
which tailors or adapts principles of Cognitive Psychology to the cybersecurity
domain while embracing new notions and concepts that are unique to the
cybersecurity domain."
"This paper addresses the prevalent lack of tools to facilitate and empower
Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. The
primary contribution is the introduction of ExploitFlow (EF), an AI and Game
Theory-driven modular library designed for cyber security exploitation. EF aims
to automate attacks, combining exploits from various sources, and capturing
system states post-action to reason about them and understand potential attack
trees. The motivation behind EF is to bolster Game Theory and AI research in
cybersecurity, with robotics as the initial focus. Results indicate that EF is
effective for exploring machine learning in robot cybersecurity. An artificial
agent powered by EF, using Reinforcement Learning, outperformed both
brute-force and human expert approaches, laying the path for using ExploitFlow
for further research. Nonetheless, we identified several limitations in
EF-driven agents, including a propensity to overfit, the scarcity and
production cost of datasets for generalization, and challenges in interpreting
networking states across varied security settings. To leverage the strengths of
ExploitFlow while addressing identified shortcomings, we present Malism, our
vision for a comprehensive automated penetration testing framework with
ExploitFlow at its core."
"We study a game-theoretic model of the interactions between a Cyber-Physical
System's (CPS) operator (the defender) against an attacker who launches
stepping-stone attacks to reach critical assets within the CPS. We consider
that, in addition to optimally allocating its security budget to protect the
assets, the defender may choose to modify the CPS through network design
interventions. In particular, we propose and motivate four ways in which the
defender can introduce additional nodes in the CPS: these nodes may be intended
as additional safeguards, be added for functional or structural redundancies,
or introduce additional functionalities in the system. We analyze the security
implications of each of these design interventions, and evaluate their impacts
on the security of an automotive network as our case study. We motivate the
choice of the attack graph for this case study and elaborate how the parameters
in the resulting security game are selected using the CVSS metrics and the
ISO-26262 ASIL ratings as guidance. We then use numerical experiments to verify
and evaluate how our proposed network interventions may be used to guide
improvements in automotive security."
"This research paper proposes a framework for building a resilient
cybersecurity posture that leverages prevent, detect, and respond functions and
law enforcement collaboration. The Cybersecurity Resilience and Law Enforcement
Collaboration (CyRLEC) Framework is designed to provide a comprehensive and
integrated approach to cybersecurity that emphasizes collaboration with law
enforcement agencies to mitigate cyber threats. The paper compares and
contrasts the CyRLEC Framework with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and
highlights the critical differences between the two frameworks. While the NIST
framework focuses on managing cybersecurity risk, the CyRLEC Framework takes a
broader view of cybersecurity, including proactive prevention, early detection,
rapid response to cyber-attacks, and close collaboration with law enforcement
agencies to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals. The paper also provides a
case study of a simulated real-world implementation of the CyRLEC Framework and
evaluates its effectiveness in improving an organization's cybersecurity
posture. The research findings demonstrate the value of the CyRLEC Framework in
enhancing cybersecurity resilience and promoting effective collaboration with
law enforcement agencies. Overall, this research paper contributes to the
growing knowledge of cybersecurity frameworks and provides practical insights
for organizations seeking to improve their cybersecurity posture."
"With the increase in cybersecurity vulnerabilities of software systems, the
ways to exploit them are also increasing. Besides these, malware threats,
irregular network interactions, and discussions about exploits in public forums
are also on the rise. To identify these threats faster, to detect potentially
relevant entities from any texts, and to be aware of software vulnerabilities,
automated approaches are necessary. Application of natural language processing
(NLP) techniques in the Cybersecurity domain can help in achieving this.
However, there are challenges such as the diverse nature of texts involved in
the cybersecurity domain, the unavailability of large-scale publicly available
datasets, and the significant cost of hiring subject matter experts for
annotations. One of the solutions is building multi-task models that can be
trained jointly with limited data. In this work, we introduce a generative
multi-task model, Unified Text-to-Text Cybersecurity (UTS), trained on malware
reports, phishing site URLs, programming code constructs, social media data,
blogs, news articles, and public forum posts. We show UTS improves the
performance of some cybersecurity datasets. We also show that with a few
examples, UTS can be adapted to novel unseen tasks and the nature of data"
"Cyber security is considered a necessity for anyone in todays modern world.
Awareness of cyber security standards and best practices have become mandatory
to safeguard ones child in this day and age. High schoolers today do not
understand cyber security threats due to the lack of parental involvement or
the lack of educational material and courses in high school. This study
developed a framework that addresses the lack of cybersecurity awareness for
high school students. The proposed framework gives a flow of steps to provide
effective awareness approaches for k12. This was achieved using an approach of
creating a functional operational framework that consists of four phases which
are Threats and Attacks Identification, Existing Awareness Discovery, Creating
Awareness Approach, and Awareness Approach Evaluation. The output resulted in a
cybersecurity awareness approach specifically for the k-12 age range, which
leverages cybersecurity emojis. Thus, by exploring this approach, the security
community can enroll and lure teenagers into cybersecurity and raise the degree
of security awareness."
"Given the ongoing ""arms race"" in cybersecurity, the shortage of skilled
professionals in this field is one of the strongest in computer science. The
currently unmet staffing demand in cybersecurity is estimated at over 3 million
jobs worldwide. Furthermore, the qualifications of the existing workforce are
largely believed to be insufficient. We attempt to gain deeper insights into
the nature of the current skill gap in cybersecurity. To this end, we correlate
data from job ads and academic curricula using two kinds of skill
characterizations: manual definitions from established skill frameworks as well
as ""skill topics"" automatically derived by text mining tools. Our analysis
shows a strong agreement between these two analysis techniques and reveals a
substantial undersupply in several crucial skill categories, e.g., software and
application security, security management, requirements engineering,
compliance, and certification. Based on the results of our analysis, we provide
recommendations for future curricula development in cybersecurity so as to
decrease the identified skill gaps."
"Smart local energy system (SLES) is considered as a promising pathway
facilitating a more effective and localised operation, benefited from the
complex information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures and
Internet of things (IoT) technologies. As a part of the critical
infrastructure, it is important to not only put effective detection and
management to tackle potential cybersecurity issues, but also require
considerable numbers of standards to ensure the security of the internet of
things system to minimise the risks. This study aims to review the existing
standards, investigate how the compatibility with SLES development, and
identify the area to focus on in the future. Although existing standards and
protocols are highly fragmented, our findings suggest that many of them can
meet the requirements of the applications and infrastructures of SLES.
Additionally, many standards have been introduced to protect information
security and personal privacy due to their increasing importance. The research
also suggests that the industry needs to produce more affordable and
cyber-secured devices and services. For the government and regulators, relevant
guidelines on the minimum function and security requirements for applications
should be provided. Additionally, compliance testing and certifications should
be in place and carried out by an independent third party to ensure the
components of SLES ecosystem with a satisfied security level by design."
"In today's globally networked environment, information security incidents can
inflict staggering financial losses on organizations. Industry reports indicate
that fundamental problems exist with the application of current linear
plan-driven security incident response approaches being applied in many
organizations. Researchers argue that traditional approaches value containment
and eradication over incident learning. While previous security incident
response research focused on best practice development, linear plan-driven
approaches and the technical aspects of security incident response, very little
research investigates the integration of agile principles and practices into
the security incident response process. This paper proposes that the
integration of disciplined agile principles and practices into the security
incident response process is a practical solution to strengthening an
organization's security incident response posture."
"This paper addresses: Evolution of the space systems environment, including
space system proliferation and space systems as critical infrastructure Cyber
threats to, and vulnerabilities of, space systems Alternative approaches to
meeting these threats, and the significance of norms Approaches to the
development and reinforcement of norms for the cybersecurity of space systems."
"In today's digitally interconnected world, cybersecurity threats have reached
unprecedented levels, presenting a pressing concern for individuals,
organizations, and governments. This study employs a qualitative research
approach to comprehensively examine the diverse threats of cybersecurity and
their impacts across various sectors. Four primary categories of threats are
identified and analyzed, encompassing malware attacks, social engineering
attacks, network vulnerabilities, and data breaches. The research delves into
the consequences of these threats on individuals, organizations, and society at
large. The findings reveal a range of key emerging threats in cybersecurity,
including advanced persistent threats, ransomware attacks, Internet of Things
(IoT) vulnerabilities, and social engineering exploits. Consequently, it is
evident that emerging cybersecurity threats pose substantial risks to both
organizations and individuals. The sophistication and diversity of these
emerging threats necessitate a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This
approach should include robust security measures, comprehensive employee
training, and regular security audits. The implications of these emerging
threats are extensive, with potential consequences such as financial loss,
reputational damage, and compromised personal information. This study
emphasizes the importance of implementing effective measures to mitigate these
threats. It highlights the significance of using strong passwords, encryption
methods, and regularly updating software to bolster cyber defenses."
"The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) (in the United
States) has published on October 19, 2015, a white paper on ""privacy-enhanced
identity brokers."" We present here a reply to their request for public
comments. We enumerate concerns whose consideration we find paramount for the
design of a privacy-enhancing identity brokering solution, for identification
and authentication of citizens into myriad online services, and we recommend
how to incorporate them into a revised white paper. Our observations, focused
on privacy, security, auditability and forensics, are mostly based on a
recently published research paper (PETS 2015) about two nation-scale brokered
identification systems."
"The black-box nature of artificial intelligence (AI) models has been the
source of many concerns in their use for critical applications. Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a rapidly growing research field that aims to
create machine learning models that can provide clear and interpretable
explanations for their decisions and actions. In the field of network
cybersecurity, XAI has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach
network security by enabling us to better understand the behavior of cyber
threats and to design more effective defenses. In this survey, we review the
state of the art in XAI for cybersecurity in network systems and explore the
various approaches that have been proposed to address this important problem.
The review follows a systematic classification of network-driven cybersecurity
threats and issues. We discuss the challenges and limitations of current XAI
methods in the context of cybersecurity and outline promising directions for
future research."
"Digital security technology is able to identify and prevent many threats to
users accounts. However, some threats remain that, to provide reliable
security, require human intervention: e.g., through users paying attention to
warning messages or completing secondary authentication procedures. While prior
work has broadly explored people's mental models of digital security threats,
we know little about users' precise, in-the-moment response process to
in-the-wild threats. In this work, we conduct a series of qualitative
interviews (n=67) with users who had recently experienced suspicious login
incidents on their real Facebook accounts in order to explore this process of
account security incident response. We find a common process across
participants from five countries -- with differing online and offline cultures
-- allowing us to identify areas for future technical development to best
support user security. We provide additional insights on the unique nature of
incident-response information seeking, known attacker threat models, and
lessons learned from a large, cross-cultural qualitative study of digital
security."
"In Europe and indeed worldwide, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
provides protection to individuals regarding their personal data in the face of
new technological developments. GDPR is widely viewed as the benchmark for data
protection and privacy regulations that harmonizes data privacy laws across
Europe. Although the GDPR is highly beneficial to individuals, it presents
significant challenges for organizations monitoring or storing personal
information. Since there is currently no automated solution with broad
industrial applicability, organizations have no choice but to carry out
expensive manual audits to ensure GDPR compliance. In this paper, we present a
complete GDPR UML model as a first step towards designing automated methods for
checking GDPR compliance. Given that the practical application of the GDPR is
influenced by national laws of the EU Member States, we suggest a two-tiered
description of the GDPR, generic and specialized. In this paper, we provide (1)
the GDPR conceptual model we developed with complete traceability from its
classes to the GDPR, (2) a glossary to help understand the model, (3) the
plain-English description of 35 compliance rules derived from GDPR along with
their encoding in OCL, and (4) the set of 20 variations points derived from
GDPR to specialize the generic model. We further present the challenges we
faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future
directions for research."
"Secure vehicular communication is a critical factor for secure traffic
management. Effective security in intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
requires effective and timely intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this paper,
we consider false data injection attacks and distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks, especially the stealthy DDoS attacks, targeting the integrity
and availability, respectively, in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). Novel
statistical intrusion detection and mitigation techniques based on centralized
communications through roadside units (RSU) are proposed for the considered
attacks. The performance of the proposed methods are evaluated using a traffic
simulator and a real traffic dataset. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art
solutions clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods
in terms of quick and accurate detection and localization of cyberattacks."
"Security Analysts that work in a `Security Operations Center' (SoC) play a
major role in ensuring the security of the organization. The amount of
background knowledge they have about the evolving and new attacks makes a
significant difference in their ability to detect attacks. Open source threat
intelligence sources, like text descriptions about cyber-attacks, can be stored
in a structured fashion in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. A cybersecurity
knowledge graph can be paramount in aiding a security analyst to detect cyber
threats because it stores a vast range of cyber threat information in the form
of semantic triples which can be queried. A semantic triple contains two
cybersecurity entities with a relationship between them. In this work, we
propose a system to create semantic triples over cybersecurity text, using deep
learning approaches to extract possible relationships. We use the set of
semantic triples generated through our system to assert in a cybersecurity
knowledge graph. Security Analysts can retrieve this data from the knowledge
graph, and use this information to form a decision about a cyber-attack."
"The prominence and use of the concept of cyber risk has been rising in recent
years. This paper presents empirical investigations focused on two important
and distinct groups within the broad community of cyber-defense professionals
and researchers: (1) cyber practitioners and (2) developers of cyber
ontologies. The key finding of this work is that the ways the concept of cyber
risk is treated by practitioners of cybersecurity is largely inconsistent with
definitions of cyber risk commonly offered in the literature. Contrary to
commonly cited definitions of cyber risk, concepts such as the likelihood of an
event and the extent of its impact are not used by cybersecurity practitioners.
This is also the case for use of these concepts in the current generation of
cybersecurity ontologies. Instead, terms and concepts reflective of the
adversarial nature of cyber defense appear to take the most prominent roles.
This research offers the first quantitative empirical evidence that rejection
of traditional concepts of cyber risk by cybersecurity professionals is indeed
observed in real-world practice."
"Cybersecurity Dynamics is new concept that aims to achieve the modeling,
analysis, quantification, and management of cybersecurity from a holistic
perspective, rather than from a building-blocks perspective. It is centered at
modeling and analyzing the attack-defense interactions in cyberspace, which
cause a ``natural'' phenomenon -- the evolution of the global cybersecurity
state. In this Chapter, we systematically introduce and review the
Cybersecurity Dynamics foundation for the Science of Cybersecurity. We review
the core concepts, technical approaches, research axes, and results that have
been obtained in this endeavor. We outline a research roadmap towards the
ultimate research goal, including a systematic set of technical barriers."
"Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of
security attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly
implemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make
them susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT
forensics is thus needed for investigating and mitigating such attacks. While
many works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have
focused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper
reviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields.
Future prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also
highlighted. As demonstrated in the literature, most IoT devices are vulnerable
to attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users
could get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical
infrastructure. To fulfil the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be
used to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is
highly scalable and adaptable. Utilizing a blockchain-based authentication
mechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security
protection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to
develop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for
detecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should
consider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data
to develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate
academics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby
advancing the IoT field."
"Network security morning (NSM) is essential for any cybersecurity system,
where the average cost of a cyber attack is 1.1 million. No matter how secure a
system, it will eventually fail without proper and continuous monitoring. No
wonder that the cybersecurity market is expected to grow up to $170.4 billion
in 2022. However, the majority of legacy industries do not invest in NSM
implementation until it is too late due to the initial and operation costs and
static unutilized resources. Thus, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Internet
of things (IoT) architecture for an industrial NSM that features a low
installation and operation cost, low power consumption, intelligent
organization behavior, and environmentally friendly operation. As a case study,
the system is implemented in a mid-range oil a gas manufacturing facility in
the southern states with more than 300 machines and servers over three remote
locations and a production plant that features a challenging atmosphere
condition. The proposed system successfully shows a significant saving (>65%)
in power consumption, acquires one-tenth of the installation cost, develops an
intelligent operation expert system tool as well as saves the environment from
more than 500mg of CO2 pollution per hour, promoting green IoT systems."
"Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field of research that
leverages quantum computing to improve the classical machine learning approach
to solve complex real world problems. QML has the potential to address
cybersecurity related challenges. Considering the novelty and complex
architecture of QML, resources are not yet explicitly available that can pave
cybersecurity learners to instill efficient knowledge of this emerging
technology. In this research, we design and develop QML-based ten learning
modules covering various cybersecurity topics by adopting student centering
case-study based learning approach. We apply one subtopic of QML on a
cybersecurity topic comprised of pre-lab, lab, and post-lab activities towards
providing learners with hands-on QML experiences in solving real-world security
problems. In order to engage and motivate students in a learning environment
that encourages all students to learn, pre-lab offers a brief introduction to
both the QML subtopic and cybersecurity problem. In this paper, we utilize
quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for malware classification and protection
where we use open source Pennylane QML framework on the drebin215 dataset. We
demonstrate our QSVM model and achieve an accuracy of 95% in malware
classification and protection. We will develop all the modules and introduce
them to the cybersecurity community in the coming days."
"Security is one of the biggest concern in power system operation. Recently,
the emerging cyber security threats to operational functions of power systems
arouse high public attention, and cybersecurity vulnerability thus become an
emerging topic to evaluate compromised operational performance under cyber
attack. In this paper, vulnerability of cyber security of load frequency
control (LFC) system, which is the key component in energy manage system (EMS),
is assessed by exploiting the system response to attacks on LFC
variables/parameters. Two types of attacks: 1) injection attack and 2) scale
attack are considered for evaluation. Two evaluation criteria reflecting the
damage on system stability and power generation are used to quantify system
loss under cyber attacks. Through a sensitivity-based method and attack tree
models, the vulnerability of different LFC components is ranked. In addition, a
post-intrusion cyber attack detection scheme is proposed. Classification-based
schemes using typical classification algorithms are studied and compared to
identify different attack scenarios."
"This paper provides the first large-scale data-driven analysis to evaluate
the predictive power of different attributes for assessing risk of cyberattack
data breaches. Furthermore, motivated by rapid increase in third party enabled
cyberattacks, the paper provides the first quantitative empirical evidence that
digital supply-chain attributes are significant predictors of enterprise cyber
risk. The paper leverages outside-in cyber risk scores that aim to capture the
quality of the enterprise internal cybersecurity management, but augment these
with supply chain features that are inspired by observed third party
cyberattack scenarios, as well as concepts from network science research. The
main quantitative result of the paper is to show that supply chain network
features add significant detection power to predicting enterprise cyber risk,
relative to merely using enterprise-only attributes. Particularly, compared to
a base model that relies only on internal enterprise features, the supply chain
network features improve the out-of-sample AUC by 2.3\%. Given that each cyber
data breach is a low probability high impact risk event, these improvements in
the prediction power have significant value. Additionally, the model highlights
several cybersecurity risk drivers related to third party cyberattack and
breach mechanisms and provides important insights as to what interventions
might be effective to mitigate these risks."
"Blockchains have received much attention recently since they provide
decentralized approaches to the creation and management of value. Many banks,
Internet companies, car manufacturers, and even governments worldwide have
incorporated or started considering blockchains to improve the security,
scalability, and efficiency of their services. In this paper, we survey
blockchain applications in different areas. These areas include cryptocurrency,
healthcare, advertising, insurance, copyright protection, energy, and societal
applications. Our work provides a timely summary for individuals and
organizations interested in blockchains. We envision our study to motivate more
blockchain applications."
"The purpose of this research was to synthesize basic and fundamental findings
in quantum computing, as applied to the attack and defense of conventional
computer networks. The concept focuses on uses of radio waves as a shield for,
and attack against traditional computers. A logic bomb is analogous to a
landmine in a computer network, and if one was to implement it as non-trivial
mitigation, it will aid computer network defense. As has been seen in kinetic
warfare, the use of landmines has been devastating to geopolitical regions in
that they are severely difficult for a civilian to avoid triggering given the
unknown position of a landmine. Thus, the importance of understanding a logic
bomb is relevant and has corollaries to quantum mechanics as well. The research
synthesizes quantum logic phase shifts in certain respects using the Dynamic
Data Exchange protocol in software written for this work, as well as a C-NOT
gate applied to a virtual quantum circuit environment by implementing a Quantum
Fourier Transform. The research focus applies the principles of coherence and
entanglement from quantum physics, the concept of expert systems in artificial
intelligence, principles of prime number based cryptography with trapdoor
functions, and modeling radio wave propagation against an event from unknown
parameters. This comes as a program relying on the artificial intelligence
concept of an expert system in conjunction with trigger events for a trapdoor
function relying on infinite recursion, as well as system mechanics for
elliptic curve cryptography along orbital angular momenta. Here trapdoor both
denotes the form of cipher, as well as the implied relationship to logic bombs."
"Cybersecurity challenges and the need for awareness are well-recognized in
developed countries, but this still needs attention in less-developed
countries. With the expansion of technology, security concerns are also
becoming more prevalent worldwide. This paper presents a design and creation
research study exploring which factors we should consider when designing
cybersecurity awareness solutions for young people in developing countries. We
have developed prototypes of mini-cybersecurity awareness applications and
conducted a pilot study with eight participants (aged 16-30) from Gambia,
Eritrea, and Syria. Our findings show that factors like the influence of
culture and social constructs, literacy, and language competence, the way of
introducing cybersecurity terms and concepts, and the need for reflection are
essential to consider when designing and developing cybersecurity awareness
solutions for target users in developing countries. The findings of this study
will guide future researchers to design more inclusive cybersecurity awareness
solutions for users in developing countries."
"The increase of cyberattacks using IoT devices has exposed the
vulnerabilities in the infrastructures that make up the IoT and have shown how
small devices can affect networks and services functioning. This paper presents
a review of the vulnerabilities of the wireless technologies that bear the IoT
and assessing the experiences in implementing wireless attacks targeting the
Internet of Things using Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technologies. A
systematic literature review was conducted. The types of vulnerabilities and
attacks that can affect the wireless technologies that stand the IoT ecosystem
and SDR radio platforms were compared. On the IoT system model layer,
perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this
level occur due to limitations in hardware, physical exposure of devices, and
heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR radios
have notable advantages due to their flexibility to adapt to new communication
technologies and their potential for the development of advanced tools.
However, cybersecurity challenges for the Internet of Things are so complex
that it is needed to merge SDR hardware with cognitive techniques and
intelligent techniques such as deep learning to adapt to rapid technological
changes."
"Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks.
As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a critical
resource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender to
keep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk of
being compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisions
often need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthy
nature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimal
timing policy under incomplete information has broad applications in
cybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application of
patches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimal
timing are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-defined
attack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case in
practice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimal
timing of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We consider
a variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback and
unknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutive
security updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associative
bandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound based
learning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodic
defense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions are
known."
"Graph models are helpful means of analyzing computer networks as well as
complex system architectures for security. In this paper we evaluate the
current state of research for representing and analysing cyber-attack using
graph models, i.e. attack graph (AG) formalisms. We propose a taxonomy on
attack graph formalisms, based on 70 models, which we analysed with respect to
their \textit{graph semantic}, involved agents and analysis features.
Additionally, we adress which formalisms allow for automatic attack graph
generation from raw or processes data inputs. Our taxonomy is especially
designed to help users and applied researchers identify a suitable AG model for
their needs. A summary of the individual AG formalisms is provided as
supplementary material."
"Evolving cybersecurity threats are a persistent challenge for
systemadministrators and security experts as new malwares are continu-ally
released. Attackers may look for vulnerabilities in commercialproducts or
execute sophisticated reconnaissance campaigns tounderstand a targets network
and gather information on securityproducts like firewalls and intrusion
detection / prevention systems(network or host-based). Many new attacks tend to
be modificationsof existing ones. In such a scenario, rule-based systems fail
to detectthe attack, even though there are minor differences in conditions
/attributes between rules to identify the new and existing attack. Todetect
these differences the IDS must be able to isolate the subset ofconditions that
are true and predict the likely conditions (differentfrom the original) that
must be observed. In this paper, we proposeaprobabilistic abductive
reasoningapproach that augments an exist-ing rule-based IDS (snort [29]) to
detect these evolved attacks by (a)Predicting rule conditions that are likely
to occur (based on existingrules) and (b) able to generate new snort rules when
provided withseed rule (i.e. a starting rule) to reduce the burden on experts
toconstantly update them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of theapproach by
generating new rules from the snort 2012 rules set andtesting it on the MACCDC
2012 dataset [6]."
"In concept, a smart charging management system (SCMS) optimizes the charging
of plug-in vehicles (PEVs) and provides various grid services including voltage
control, frequency regulation, peak shaving, renewable energy integration
support, spinning reserve, and emergency demand response. These functionalities
largely depend upon data collected from various entities such as PEVs, electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), service providers, and utilities. SCMS can be
susceptible to both cyber and physical threats (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack,
data intrigued attack, denial of charging, physical-attack) due to interactions
of and interdependencies between cyber and physical components. Cyber-physical
threats through highly connected malware vectors raise various concerns
including public safety hazards to vehicle operators and those in the immediate
vicinity as well as disruptions to electric grid operations. This paper
describes the concept of SCMS and provides a comprehensive review of the
cybersecurity aspects of EVSEs and SCMSs with their possible impacts on the
power grid and society. It also contributes to the development of cybersecurity
measures to the SCMSs. Various functions of SCMS are reviewed in detail
including peak shaving, demand charge reduction, frequency regulation, spinning
reserve, renewable integration support, distribution congestion management,
reactive power compensation, and emergency demand response with unidirectional
PEVs charging. Also, a critical literature survey on current practices of SCMS
cybersecurity is provided to explore major impacts and challenges of
cyber-physical attacks and to identify research gaps and vulnerabilities in
currently available SCMSs technologies."
"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts observed on a network or in an
operating system that can be utilized to indicate a computer intrusion and
detect cyber-attacks in an early stage. Thus, they exert an important role in
the field of cybersecurity. However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems
rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity,
and require a large amount of supervised training corpora to train an IOC
classifier. In this paper, we propose using a neural-based sequence labelling
model to identify IOCs automatically from reports on cybersecurity without
expert knowledge of cybersecurity. Our work is the first to apply an end-to-end
sequence labelling to the task in IOCs identification. By using an attention
mechanism and several token spelling features, we find that the proposed model
is capable of identifying the low frequency IOCs from long sentences contained
in cybersecurity reports. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms
other sequence labelling models, achieving over 88% average F1-score."
"Cyber intrusion attacks that compromise the users' critical and sensitive
data are escalating in volume and intensity, especially with the growing
connections between our daily life and the Internet. The large volume and high
complexity of such intrusion attacks have impeded the effectiveness of most
traditional defence techniques. While at the same time, the remarkable
performance of the machine learning methods, especially deep learning, in
computer vision, had garnered research interests from the cyber security
community to further enhance and automate intrusion detections. However, the
expensive data labeling and limitation of anomalous data make it challenging to
train an intrusion detector in a fully supervised manner. Therefore, intrusion
detection based on unsupervised anomaly detection is an important feature too.
In this paper, we propose a three-stage deep learning anomaly detection based
network intrusion attack detection framework. The framework comprises an
integration of unsupervised (K-means clustering), semi-supervised (GANomaly)
and supervised learning (CNN) algorithms. We then evaluated and showed the
performance of our implemented framework on three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD,
CIC-IDS2018, and TON_IoT."
"Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate
practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events
into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for
students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing
approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students
knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education
mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom
setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end
of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might
not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the
integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity
course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by
encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the
delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to
foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for
students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning
benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and
collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and
encouraged learning-by-doing."
"This study examines the effect of adopting cybersecurity concepts on the IT
curriculum and determines the potential effect on students' knowledge of
cybersecurity practices and level of awareness. To this end, a pilot study was
first conducted to measure the current level of cybersecurity awareness. The
results revealed that students do not have much knowledge of Cybersecurity.
Thus, a four-step approach was proposed to infuse the relevant cybersecurity
topics in five matched courses based on the latest Cybersecurity curricular
guidelines (CSEC2017). A sample of 42 students was selected purposively without
prior knowledge of Cybersecurity and divided identically into experimental and
control groups. Students in the experimental group were asked to take five
consecutive courses over five semesters. In each course, groups went through a
pre-test for the infused topics. Then, the experimental group taught the
corresponding infused topics. A post-test was administered to both groups at
the end of each course, and the t-test was conducted. The results found
significant differences between marks of prior and post-tests for 11 out of 14
infused topics. These satisfactory results would encourage universities to
infuse cybersecurity concepts into their curriculum"
"Detecting cyber-anomalies and attacks are becoming a rising concern these
days in the domain of cybersecurity. The knowledge of artificial intelligence,
particularly, the machine learning techniques can be used to tackle these
issues. However, the effectiveness of a learning-based security model may vary
depending on the security features and the data characteristics. In this paper,
we present ""CyberLearning"", a machine learning-based cybersecurity modeling
with correlated-feature selection, and a comprehensive empirical analysis on
the effectiveness of various machine learning based security models. In our
CyberLearning modeling, we take into account a binary classification model for
detecting anomalies, and multi-class classification model for various types of
cyber-attacks. To build the security model, we first employ the popular ten
machine learning classification techniques, such as naive Bayes, Logistic
regression, Stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, Support vector
machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient
Boosting, as well as Linear discriminant analysis. We then present the
artificial neural network-based security model considering multiple hidden
layers. The effectiveness of these learning-based security models is examined
by conducting a range of experiments utilizing the two most popular security
datasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a
reference point for data-driven security modeling through our experimental
analysis and findings in the context of cybersecurity."
"The automation and connectivity of CAV inherit most of the cyber-physical
vulnerabilities of incumbent technologies such as evolving network
architectures, wireless communications, and AI-based automation. This book
chapter entails the cyber-physical vulnerabilities and risks that originated in
IT, OT, and the physical domains of the CAV ecosystem, eclectic threat
landscapes, and threat intelligence. To deal with the security threats in
high-speed, high dimensional, multimodal data and assets from eccentric
stakeholders of the CAV ecosystem, this chapter presents and analyzes some of
the state of art deep learning-based threat intelligence for attack detection.
The frontiers in deep learning, namely Meta-Learning and Federated Learning,
along with their challenges have been included in the chapter. We have
proposed, trained, and tested the deep CNN-LSTM architecture for CAV threat
intelligence; assessed and compared the performance of the proposed model
against other deep learning algorithms such as DNN, CNN, LSTM. Our results
indicate the superiority of the proposed model although DNN and 1d-CNN also
achieved more than 99% of accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC on the
CAV-KDD dataset. The good performance of deep CNN-LSTM comes with the increased
model complexity and cumbersome hyperparameters tuning. Still, there are open
challenges on deep learning adoption in the CAV cybersecurity paradigm due to
lack of properly developed protocols and policies, poorly defined privileges
between stakeholders, costlier training, adversarial threats to the model, and
poor generalizability of the model under out of data distributions."
"Cybersecurity is a very emerging field that protects systems, networks, and
data from digital attacks. With the increase in the scale of the Internet and
the evolution of cyber attacks, developing novel cybersecurity tools has become
important, particularly for Internet of things (IoT) networks. This paper
provides a systematic review of the application of deep learning (DL)
approaches for cybersecurity. This paper provides a short description of DL
methods which is used in cybersecurity, including deep belief networks,
generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and others. Next,
we illustrate the differences between shallow learning and DL. Moreover, a
discussion is provided on the currently prevailing cyber-attacks in IoT and
other networks, and the effectiveness of DL methods to manage these attacks.
Besides, this paper describes studies that highlight the DL technique,
cybersecurity applications, and the source of datasets. Next, a discussion is
provided on the feasibility of DL systems for malware detection and
classification, intrusion detection, and other frequent cyber-attacks,
including identifying file type, spam, and network traffic. Our review
indicates that high classification accuracy of 99.72% is obtained by restricted
Boltzmann machine (RBM) when applied to a custom dataset, while long short-term
memory (LSTM) achieves an accuracy of 99.80% for KDD Cup 99 dataset. Finally,
this article discusses the importance of cybersecurity for reliable and
practicable IoT-driven healthcare systems."
"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts observed on a network or in an
operating system that can be utilized to indicate a computer intrusion and
detect cyber-attacks in an early stage. Thus, they exert an important role in
the field of cybersecurity. However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems
rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity,
and require large-scale manually annotated corpora to train an IOC classifier.
In this paper, we propose using an end-to-end neural-based sequence labelling
model to identify IOCs automatically from cybersecurity articles without expert
knowledge of cybersecurity. By using a multi-head self-attention module and
contextual features, we find that the proposed model is capable of gathering
contextual information from texts of cybersecurity articles and performs better
in the task of IOC identification. Experiments show that the proposed model
outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving the average F1-score of
89.0% on English cybersecurity article test set, and approximately the average
F1-score of 81.8% on Chinese test set."
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to attack graphs for penetration
testing, however, trained agents do not reflect reality because the attack
graphs lack operational nuances typically captured within the intelligence
preparation of the battlefield (IPB) that include notions of (cyber) terrain.
In particular, current practice constructs attack graphs exclusively using the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and its components. We present
methods for constructing attack graphs using notions from IPB on cyber terrain
analysis of obstacles, avenues of approach, key terrain, observation and fields
of fire, and cover and concealment. We demonstrate our methods on an example
where firewalls are treated as obstacles and represented in (1) the reward
space and (2) the state dynamics. We show that terrain analysis can be used to
bring realism to attack graphs for RL."
"This article attempts to discover the surreptitious features of ransomware
and to address it in information systems security research. It intends to
elicit attention with regard to ransomware, a newly emerged cyber threat using
such encryption technology as RSA, and to help both academic researchers and IT
practitioners understand the technological characteristics of ransomware, along
with its severity analysis. As ransomware infections continue to rise and
attacks employing refined algorithm become increasingly sophisticated, data
protection faces serious challenges. The article discusses future trends and
research directions related to ransomware, and provides prevention strategies
for SMEs."
"Data-intensive applications exhibit increasing reliance on Database
Management Systems (DBMSs, for short). With the growing cyber-security threats
to government and commercial infrastructures, the need to develop high
resilient cyber systems is becoming increasingly important. Cyber-attacks on
DBMSs include intrusion attacks that may result in severe degradation in
performance. Several efforts have been directed towards designing an integrated
management system to detect, respond, and recover from malicious attacks. In
this paper, we propose a data Partitioning-based Intrusion Management System
(PIMS, for short) that can endure intense malicious intrusion attacks on DBMS.
The novelty in PIMS is the ability to contain the damage into data partitions,
termed Intrusion Boundaries (IBs, for short). The IB Demarcation Problem (IBDP,
for short) is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming. We prove
that IBDP is NP-hard. Accordingly, two heuristic solutions for IBDP are
introduced. The proposed architecture for PIMS includes novel IB-centric
response and recovery mechanisms, which executes compensating transactions.
PIMS is prototyped within PostgreSQL, an open-source DBMS. Finally, empirical
and experimental performance evaluation of PIMS are conducted to demonstrate
that intelligent partitioning of data tuples improves the overall availability
of the DBMS under intrusion attacks."
"The promise of quantum computing is not speeding up conventional computing
rather delivering an exponential advantage for certain classes of problems,
with profound implications for cybersecurity for instance. With the advent and
development of quantum computers, cyberspace security can surely become the
most critical problem for the Internet in near future. On contrary, prosaic
quantum technology can be promising to transform cybersecurity. This research
aims to synthesize basic and fundamental studies concerning quantum
cybersecurity that can be emerged both as a threat and solution to critical
cybersecurity issues based on a systematic study. We provide a comprehensive,
illustrative description of the current state-of-the-art quantum computing and
cybersecurity and present the proposed approaches to date. Findings in quantum
computing cybersecurity suggest that quantum computing can be adopted for the
betterment of cybersecurity threats while it poses the most unexpected threats
to cybersecurity. The focus and depth of this systematic survey not only
provide quantum and cybersecurity practitioners and researchers with a
consolidated body of knowledge about current trends in this area but also
underpins a starting point for further research in this field."
"Current network security systems are progressively showing their limitations.
One credible estimate is that only about 45% of new threats are detected.
Therefore it is vital to find a new direction that cybersecurity development
should follow. We argue that the next generation of cybersecurity systems
should seek inspiration in nature. This approach has been used before in the
first generation of cybersecurity systems; however, since then cyber threats
and environment have evolved significantly, and accordingly the
first-generation systems have lost their effectiveness. A next generation of
bio-inspired cybersecurity research is emerging, but progress is hindered by
the lack of a framework for mapping biological security systems to their cyber
analogies. In this paper, using terminology and concepts from biology, we
describe a cybersecurity ecology and a framework that may be used to
systematically research and develop bio-inspired cybersecurity."
"This paper proposes an analysis of the prospects of the cyber security
industry and educational ecosystems in four Southeast Asian countries, namely
Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which are along the Maritime Silk
Road, by using two novel metrics: the ""Cybersecurity Education Prospects Index""
(CEPI) and the ""Cybersecurity Industry Prospects Index"" (CIPI). The CEPI
evaluates the state of cybersecurity education by assessing the availability
and quality of cybersecurity degrees together with their ability to attract new
students. On the other hand, the CIPI measures the potential for the
cybersecurity industry's growth and development by assessing the talent pool
needed to build and sustain its growth. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the
vital importance of a healthy cybersecurity ecosystem where education is
responsible for supporting the industry to ensure the security and reliability
of commercial operations in these countries against a complex and evolving
cyber threat landscape."
"Spear phishing is a complex targeted attack in which, an attacker harvests
information about the victim prior to the attack. This information is then used
to create sophisticated, genuine-looking attack vectors, drawing the victim to
compromise confidential information. What makes spear phishing different, and
more powerful than normal phishing, is this contextual information about the
victim. Online social media services can be one such source for gathering vital
information about an individual. In this paper, we characterize and examine a
true positive dataset of spear phishing, spam, and normal phishing emails from
Symantec's enterprise email scanning service. We then present a model to detect
spear phishing emails sent to employees of 14 international organizations, by
using social features extracted from LinkedIn. Our dataset consists of 4,742
targeted attack emails sent to 2,434 victims, and 9,353 non targeted attack
emails sent to 5,912 non victims; and publicly available information from their
LinkedIn profiles. We applied various machine learning algorithms to this
labeled data, and achieved an overall maximum accuracy of 97.76% in identifying
spear phishing emails. We used a combination of social features from LinkedIn
profiles, and stylometric features extracted from email subjects, bodies, and
attachments. However, we achieved a slightly better accuracy of 98.28% without
the social features. Our analysis revealed that social features extracted from
LinkedIn do not help in identifying spear phishing emails. To the best of our
knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to make use of a combination of
stylometric features extracted from emails, and social features extracted from
an online social network to detect targeted spear phishing emails."
"Strategic decisions rely heavily on non-scientific instrumentation to
forecast emerging technologies and leading companies. Instead, we build a fast
quantitative system with a small computational footprint to discover the most
important technologies and companies in a given field, using generalisable
methods applicable to any industry. With the help of patent data from the US
Patent and Trademark Office, we first assign a value to each patent thanks to
automated machine learning tools. We then apply network science to track the
interaction and evolution of companies and clusters of patents (i.e.
technologies) to create rankings for both sets that highlight important or
emerging network nodes thanks to five network centrality indices. Finally, we
illustrate our system with a case study based on the cybersecurity industry.
Our results produce useful insights, for instance by highlighting (i) emerging
technologies with a growing mean patent value and cluster size, (ii) the most
influential companies in the field and (iii) attractive startups with few but
impactful patents. Complementary analysis also provides evidence of decreasing
marginal returns of research and development in larger companies in the
cybersecurity industry."
"Causal questions often permeate in our day-to-day activities. With causal
reasoning and counterfactual intuition, privacy threats can not only be
alleviated but also prevented. In this paper, we discuss what is causal and
counterfactual reasoning and how this can be applied in the field of privacy
threat modelling (PTM). We believe that the future of PTM relies on how we can
causally and counterfactually imagine cybersecurity threats and incidents."
"Recent years have shown us the importance of cybersecurity. Especially, when
the matter is national security, it is even more essential and crucial.
Increasing cyber attacks, especially between countries in governmental level,
created a new term cyber warfare. Creating some rules and regulations for this
kind of war is necessary therefore international justice systems are working on
it continuously. In this paper, we mentioned fundamental terms of
cybersecurity, cyber capabilities of some countries, some important cyber
attacks in near past, and finally, globally applied cyber warfare law for this
attacks."
"Based on classical contagion models we introduce an artificial cyber lab: the
digital twin of a complex cyber system in which possible cyber resilience
measures may be implemented and tested. Using the lab, in numerical case
studies, we identify two classes of measures to control systemic cyber risks:
security- and topology-based interventions. We discuss the implications of our
findings on selected real-world cybersecurity measures currently applied in the
insurance and regulation practice or under discussion for future cyber risk
control. To this end, we provide a brief overview of the current cybersecurity
regulation and emphasize the role of insurance companies as private regulators.
Moreover, from an insurance point of view, we provide first attempts to design
systemic cyber risk obligations and to measure the systemic risk contribution
of individual policyholders."
"Information about the privacy and security of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices is not readily available to consumers who want to consider it before
making purchase decisions. While legislators have proposed adding succinct,
consumer accessible, labels, they do not provide guidance on the content of
these labels. In this paper, we report on the results of a series of interviews
and surveys with privacy and security experts, as well as consumers, where we
explore and test the design space of the content to include on an IoT privacy
and security label. We conduct an expert elicitation study by following a
three-round Delphi process with 22 privacy and security experts to identify the
factors that experts believed are important for consumers when comparing the
privacy and security of IoT devices to inform their purchase decisions. Based
on how critical experts believed each factor is in conveying risk to consumers,
we distributed these factors across two layers---a primary layer to display on
the product package itself or prominently on a website, and a secondary layer
available online through a web link or a QR code. We report on the experts'
rationale and arguments used to support their choice of factors. Moreover, to
study how consumers would perceive the privacy and security information
specified by experts, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with
15 participants, who had purchased at least one IoT device (smart home device
or wearable). Based on the results of our expert elicitation and consumer
studies, we propose a prototype privacy and security label to help consumers
make more informed IoT-related purchase decisions."
"Malware threat intelligence uncovers deep information about malware, threat
actors, and their tactics, Indicators of Compromise(IoC), and vulnerabilities
in different platforms from scattered threat sources. This collective
information can guide decision making in cyber defense applications utilized by
security operation centers(SoCs). In this paper, we introduce an open-source
malware ontology - MALOnt that allows the structured extraction of information
and knowledge graph generation, especially for threat intelligence. The
knowledge graph that uses MALOnt is instantiated from a corpus comprising
hundreds of annotated malware threat reports. The knowledge graph enables the
analysis, detection, classification, and attribution of cyber threats caused by
malware. We also demonstrate the annotation process using MALOnt on exemplar
threat intelligence reports. A work in progress, this research is part of a
larger effort towards auto-generation of knowledge graphs (KGs)for gathering
malware threat intelligence from heterogeneous online resources."
"In recent years the cybersecurity policy debate in Washington has been
dominated by calls for greater information sharing within the private sector,
and between the private sector and the federal government. The passage of the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) (signed into law under the
Cybersecurity Act of 2015) underscored federal efforts to collect information
from the private sector, and assuaged some concerns regarding private sector
liability in sharing activities. However, the law lacked specificity on how
continued federal efforts would work with existing information sharing
networks, and failed to address other challenges associated with sharing
including trust building, privacy and propriety interests, reciprocation, and
quality control. This paper aims to bring granularity to implementations of
information sharing initiatives by creating a taxonomy of the governance and
policy models within each of these organizations. The research shows how this
diverse ecosystem of sharing models work together and separately, and the
impact governance and policy have on key components critical to sharing
infrastructure."
"Cybersecurity information sharing (CIS) is envisioned to protect
organizations more effectively from advanced cyber attacks. However, a
completely automated CIS platform is not widely adopted. The major challenges
are: (1) the absence of a robust cyber threat language (CTL) and (2) the
concerns over data privacy. This work introduces Cybersecurity Information
Exchangewith Privacy (CYBEX-P), as a CIS framework, to tackle these challenges.
CYBEX-P allows organizations to share heterogeneous data with granular,
attribute based privacy control. It correlates the data to automatically
generate intuitive reports and defensive rules. To achieve such versatility, we
have developed TAHOE - a graph based CTL. TAHOE is a structure for
storing,sharing and analyzing threat data. It also intrinsically correlates the
data. We have further developed a universal Threat Data Query Language (TDQL).
In this paper, we propose the system architecture for CYBEX-P. We then discuss
its scalability and privacy features along with a use case of CYBEX-P providing
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). We further introduce TAHOE& TDQL as better
alternatives to existing CTLs and formulate ThreatRank - an algorithm to detect
new malicious even"
"With the rising number of cyberattacks, such as ransomware attacks and cyber
espionage, educating non-cybersecurity professionals to recognize threats has
become more important than ever before. However, traditional training methods,
such as phishing awareness campaigns, training videos and assessments have
proven to be less effective over time. Therefore, it is time to rethink the
approach on how to train cyber awareness. In this paper we suggest an
alternative approach -- a serious game -- to educate awareness for common
cyberattacks. While many serious games for cybersecurity education exist, all
follow a very similar approach: showing people the effects of a cyber attack on
their own system or company network. For example, one of the main tasks in
these games is to sort out phishing mails. We developed and evaluated a new
type of cybersecurity game: an attack simulator, which shows the entire setting
from a different perspective. Instead of sorting out phishing mails the players
should write phishing mails to trick potential victims and use other forms of
cyberattacks. Our game explains the intention of each attack and shows the
consequences of a successful attack. This way, we hope, players will get a
better understanding on how to detect cyberattacks."
"Automated adversary emulation is becoming an indispensable tool of network
security operators in testing and evaluating their cyber defenses. At the same
time, it has exposed how quickly adversaries can propagate through the network.
While research has greatly progressed on quality decoy generation to fool human
adversaries, we may need different strategies to slow computer agents. In this
paper, we show that decoy generation can slow an automated agent's decision
process, but that the degree to which it is inhibited is greatly dependent on
the types of objects used. This points to the need to explicitly evaluate decoy
generation and placement strategies against fast moving, automated adversaries."
"Past Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks on Industrial
Internet-of-Things (IIoT), such as the 2016 Ukrainian power grid attack and the
2017 Saudi petrochemical plant attack, have shown the disruptive effects of APT
campaigns while new IIoT malware continue to be developed by APT groups.
Existing APT detection systems have been designed using cyberattack TTPs
modelled for enterprise IT networks and leverage specific data sources (e.g.,
Linux audit logs, Windows event logs) which are not found on ICS devices. In
this work, we propose RAPTOR, a system to detect APT campaigns in IIoT. Using
cyberattack TTPs modelled for ICS/OT environments and focusing on ""invariant""
attack phases, RAPTOR detects and correlates various APT attack stages in IIoT
leveraging data which can be readily collected from ICS devices/networks
(packet traffic traces, IDS alerts). Subsequently, it constructs a high-level
APT campaign graph which can be used by cybersecurity analysts towards attack
analysis and mitigation. A performance evaluation of RAPTOR's APT attack-stage
detection modules shows high precision and low false positive/negative rates.
We also show that RAPTOR is able to construct the APT campaign graph for APT
attacks (modelled after real-world attacks on ICS/OT infrastructure) executed
on our IIoT testbed."
"This position paper explores the broad landscape of AI potentiality in the
context of cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on its possible risk
factors with awareness, which can be managed by incorporating human experts in
the loop, i.e., ""Human-AI"" teaming. As artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies advance, they will provide unparalleled opportunities for attack
identification, incident response, and recovery. However, the successful
deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth
understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal
implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas.
Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that
incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may
proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern
recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and
accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders,
regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and
accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions.
Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile
in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical
thinking, or contextual understanding is combined with AI's computational power
to improve overall cyber defenses."
"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in a significant
increase in research on e-health. As the amount of patient data grows, it has
become increasingly challenging to protect patients' privacy. Patient data is
commonly stored in the cloud, making it difficult for users to control and
protect their information. Moreover, the recent rise in security and
surveillance breaches in the healthcare industry has highlighted the need for a
better approach to data storage and protection. Traditional models that rely on
third-party control over patients' healthcare data are no longer reliable, as
they have proven vulnerable to security breaches. To address these issues,
blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution. Blockchain-based
protocols have the potential to provide a secure and efficient system for
e-health applications that does not require trust in third-party
intermediaries. The proposed protocol outlined in this paper uses a
blockchain-based approach to manage patient data securely and efficiently.
Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used for financial transactions, the
protocol described here is designed specifically for e-health applications. It
employs a consensus mechanism that is more suitable for resource constrained
IoT devices, thereby reducing network costs and increasing efficiency. The
proposed protocol also provides a privacy-preserving access control mechanism
that enables patients to have more control over their healthcare data. By
leveraging blockchain technology, the protocol ensures that only authorized
individuals can access the patient's data, which helps prevent data breaches
and other security issues. Finally, the security and privacy of the proposed
protocol are analysed to ensure that it meets the necessary standards for data
protection."
"There have been extensive efforts in government, academia, and industry to
anticipate, forecast, and mitigate cyber attacks. A common approach is
time-series forecasting of cyber attacks based on data from network telescopes,
honeypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems. This research
has uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyber attacks. Here, we
propose an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of
attacks that are analyst-detected and -verified occurrences of malware. We call
these instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically, our dataset was
analyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service
Provider (CSSP) for the U.S. Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on
automated systems. Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over
approximately seven years. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts,
our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in
other sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a
number for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the
development of effective risk-management strategies. We used a Bayesian State
Space Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead could be
predicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model. Our findings of
systematicity in analyst-detected cyber attacks are consistent with previous
work using other sources. The advanced information provided by a forecast may
help with threat awareness by providing a probable value and range for future
cyber events one week ahead. Other potential applications for cyber event
forecasting include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for
cyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing and sensor configuration) in CSSPs.
Enhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity."
"Intrusion detection into computer networks has become one of the most
important issues in cybersecurity. Attackers keep on researching and coding to
discover new vulnerabilities to penetrate information security system. In
consequence computer systems must be daily upgraded using up-to-date techniques
to keep hackers at bay. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of
an intrusion detection system based on Deep Learning architectures. As a first
step, a shallow network is trained with labelled log-in [into a computer
network] data taken from the Dataset CICIDS2017. The internal behaviour of this
network is carefully tracked and tuned by using plotting and exploring codes
until it reaches a functional peak in intrusion prediction accuracy. As a
second step, an autoencoder, trained with big unlabelled data, is used as a
middle processor which feeds compressed information and abstract representation
to the original shallow network. It is proven that the resultant deep
architecture has a better performance than any version of the shallow network
alone. The resultant functional code scripts, written in MATLAB, represent a
re-trainable system which has been proved using real data, producing good
precision and fast response."
"The abundance of cyber-physical components in modern day power grid with
their diverse hardware and software vulnerabilities has made it difficult to
protect them from advanced persistent threats (APTs). An attack graph depicting
the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access
point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any
cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan
preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the
cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget
restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our
framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack
sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal
manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive
mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program
(MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures
which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential
attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy
of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for
tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement,
incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the
optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated
cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers
and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to
improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system."
"The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much attention due
to the growing number of IoT-oriented security incidents. IoT hardware and
software security vulnerabilities are exploited affecting many companies and
persons. Since the causes of vulnerabilities go beyond pure technical measures,
there is a pressing demand nowadays to demystify IoT ""security complex"" and
develop practical guidelines for both companies, consumers, and regulators. In
this paper, we present an initial study targeting an unexplored sphere in IoT
by illuminating the potential of crowdsource ethical hacking approaches for
enhancing IoT vulnerability management. We focus on Bug Bounty Programs (BBP)
and Responsible Disclosure (RD), which stimulate hackers to report
vulnerability in exchange for monetary rewards. We carried out a qualitative
investigation supported by literature survey and expert interviews to explore
how BBP and RD can facilitate the practice of identifying, classifying,
prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating IoT vulnerabilities in an effective
and cost-efficient manner. Besides deriving tangible guidelines for IoT
stakeholders, our study also sheds light on a systematic integration path to
combine BBP and RD with existing security practices (e.g., penetration test) to
further boost overall IoT security."
"In today's modern farm, an increasing number of agricultural systems and
vehicles are connected to the Internet. While the benefits of networked
agricultural machinery are attractive, this technological shift is also
creating an environment that is conducive to cyberattacks. While previous
research has focused on general cybersecurity concerns in the farming and
agricultural industries, minimal research has focused on techniques for
identifying security vulnerabilities within actual agricultural systems that
could be exploited by cybercriminals. Hence, this paper presents STAVE - a
Security Testbed for Agricultural Vehicles and Environments - as a potential
solution to assist with the identification of cybersecurity vulnerabilities
within commercially available off-the-shelf components used in certain
agricultural systems. This paper reports ongoing research efforts to develop
and refine the STAVE testbed, along with describing initial cybersecurity
experimentation which aims to identify security vulnerabilities within wireless
and Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus agricultural vehicle components."
"Poor software quality can adversely affect application security by increasing
the potential for a malicious breach of a system. Because computer security and
cybersecurity are becoming such relevant topics for practicing software
engineers, the need for educational opportunities in this area is steadily
increasing. Universities and colleges have recognized this, and have started to
offer programs in cybersecurity. At face value, these new programs may not
appear controversial, but developing their curriculum requires answering a
complex ethical question: Should programs teach hacking to their students? Even
though there are different types of hackers, media reports of cybersecurity
incidents tend to reserve the ""hacker"" label for cyber criminals, which
overlooks the value in hacking (and, by extension, teaching students to hack).
This article examines the full spectrum of hacking behavior, as well as
arguments for and against including hacking in education programs, and
recommends that hacking skills be considered an essential component of an
education and practice in software quality assurance."
"Automated cyber threat detection in computer networks is a major challenge in
cybersecurity. The cyber domain has inherent challenges that make traditional
machine learning techniques problematic, specifically the need to learn
continually evolving attacks through global collaboration while maintaining
data privacy, and the varying resources available to network owners. We present
a scheme to mitigate these difficulties through an architectural approach using
community model sharing with a streaming analytic pipeline. Our streaming
approach trains models incrementally as each log record is processed, thereby
adjusting to concept drift resulting from changing attacks. Further, we
designed a community sharing approach which federates learning through merging
models without the need to share sensitive cyber-log data. Finally, by
standardizing data and Machine Learning processes in a modular way, we provide
network security operators the ability to manage cyber threat events and model
sensitivity through community member and analytic method weighting in ways that
are best suited for their available resources and data."
"Website hacking is a frequent attack type used by malicious actors to obtain
confidential information, modify the integrity of web pages or make websites
unavailable. The tools used by attackers are becoming more and more automated
and sophisticated, and malicious machine learning agents seems to be the next
development in this line. In order to provide ethical hackers with similar
tools, and to understand the impact and the limitations of artificial agents,
we present in this paper a model that formalizes web hacking tasks for
reinforcement learning agents. Our model, named Agent Web Model, considers web
hacking as a capture-the-flag style challenge, and it defines reinforcement
learning problems at seven different levels of abstraction. We discuss the
complexity of these problems in terms of actions and states an agent has to
deal with, and we show that such a model allows to represent most of the
relevant web vulnerabilities. Aware that the driver of advances in
reinforcement learning is the availability of standardized challenges, we
provide an implementation for the first three abstraction layers, in the hope
that the community would consider these challenges in order to develop
intelligent web hacking agents."
"Experimental research methods describe standards to safeguard scientific
integrity and reputability. These methods have been extensively integrated into
traditional scientific disciplines and studied in the philosophy of science.
The field of cybersecurity is just beginning to develop preliminary research
standards and modeling practices. As such, the science of cybersecurity
routinely fails to meet empirical research criteria, such as internal validity,
external validity, and construct validity. These standards of experimentation
enable the development of metrics, create assurance of experimental soundness,
and aid in the generalizability of results. To facilitate such empirical
experimentation in cybersecurity, we propose the adaptation of camouflaged
cyber simulations as an approach for cybersecurity research. This research tool
supports this mechanistic method of experimentation and aids in the
construction of general cybersecurity research best practices."
"The North Atlantic Treaty Organizations (NATO) public-private Space Asset
Supply Chain (SASC) currently exhibits significant cybersecurity gaps. It is
well-established that data obtained from space assets is fundamental to NATO,
as they allow for the facilitation of its missions, self-defence and effective
deterrence of its adversaries. Any hostile cyber operation, suspending control
over a space asset, severely impacts both NATO missions and allied Member
States national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly
unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question:
a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can
NATO and its allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to
safeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field
study is carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with
high-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic
organizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia.
This thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs SASC are
caused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of
Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC management is
caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels and significant
understaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two major collaboration
initiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and
b) Pushing forward the creation of regulation through a standardized security
framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so would enable NATO and its Member
States to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data early on along its
cyber SASC, and thus increase transparency, responsibility, and liability."
"Artificial intelligence-based techniques applied to the electricity
consumption data generated from the smart grid prove to be an effective
solution in reducing Non Technical Loses (NTLs), thereby ensures safety,
reliability, and security of the smart energy systems. However, imbalanced
data, consecutive missing values, large training times, and complex
architectures hinder the real time application of electricity theft detection
models. In this paper, we present EnsembleNTLDetect, a robust and scalable
electricity theft detection framework that employs a set of efficient data
pre-processing techniques and machine learning models to accurately detect
electricity theft by analysing consumers' electricity consumption patterns.
This framework utilises an enhanced Dynamic Time Warping Based Imputation
(eDTWBI) algorithm to impute missing values in the time series data and
leverages the Near-miss undersampling technique to generate balanced data.
Further, stacked autoencoder is introduced for dimensionality reduction and to
improve training efficiency. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CTGAN) is used to augment the dataset to ensure robust training and a soft
voting ensemble classifier is designed to detect the consumers with aberrant
consumption patterns. Furthermore, experiments were conducted on the real-time
electricity consumption data provided by the State Grid Corporation of China
(SGCC) to validate the reliability and efficiency of EnsembleNTLDetect over the
state-of-the-art electricity theft detection models in terms of various quality
metrics."
"Internet of Things (IoT) has become a popular paradigm to fulfil needs of the
industry such as asset tracking, resource monitoring and automation. As
security mechanisms are often neglected during the deployment of IoT devices,
they are more easily attacked by complicated and large volume intrusion attacks
using advanced techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used by the
cyber security community in the past decade to automatically identify such
attacks. However, deep learning methods have yet to be extensively explored for
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) specifically for IoT. Most recent works are
based on time sequential models like LSTM and there is short of research in
CNNs as they are not naturally suited for this problem. In this article, we
propose a novel solution to the intrusion attacks against IoT devices using
CNNs. The data is encoded as the convolutional operations to capture the
patterns from the sensors data along time that are useful for attacks detection
by CNNs. The proposed method is integrated with two classical CNNs: ResNet and
EfficientNet, where the detection performance is evaluated. The experimental
results show significant improvement in both true positive rate and false
positive rate compared to the baseline using LSTM."
"Not too long ago, AI security used to mean the research and practice of how
AI can empower cybersecurity, that is, AI for security. Ever since Ian
Goodfellow and his team popularized adversarial attacks on machine learning,
security for AI became an important concern and also part of AI security. It is
imperative to understand the threats to machine learning products and avoid
common pitfalls in AI product development. This article is addressed to
developers, designers, managers and researchers of AI software products."
"Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which have emerged as an
expansion of terrestrial networks, provide flexible access, ubiquitous
coverage, high-capacity backhaul, and emergency/disaster recovery for mobile
users (MUs). While the massive benefits brought by SAGIN may improve the
quality of service, unauthorized access to SAGIN entities is potentially
dangerous. At present, conventional crypto-based authentication is facing
challenges, such as the inability to provide continuous and transparent
protection for MUs. In this article, we propose an AI-oriented two-phase
multi-factor authentication scheme (ATMAS) by introducing intelligence to
authentication. The satellite and network control center collaborate on
continuous authentication, while unique spatial-temporal features, including
service features and geographic features, are utilized to enhance the system
security. Our further security analysis and performance evaluations show that
ATMAS has proper security characteristics which can meet various security
requirements. Moreover, we shed light on lightweight and efficient
authentication mechanism design through a proper combination of
spatial-temporal factors."
"Moving Target Defense (MTD) is an emerging game-changing defense strategy in
cybersecurity with the goal of strengthening defenders and conversely puzzling
adversaries in a network environment. The successful deployment of an MTD
system can be affected by several factors including 1) the effectiveness of the
employed technique, 2) the deployment strategy, 3) the cost of the MTD
implementation, and 4) the impact yielded by the enforced security policies.
Many research efforts have been spent on introducing a variety of MTD
techniques which are often evaluated through simulations. Nevertheless, this
line of research needs more attention. In particular, the determination of
optimal cost and policy analysis and the selection of those policies in an MTD
setting is still an open research question.
  To advance the state-of-the-art of this line of research, this paper
introduces an approach based on control theory to model, analyze and select
optimal security policies for Moving Target Defense (MTD) deployment
strategies. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) scheme is presented to model states
of the system from attacking point of view. The employed value iteration method
is based on the Bellman optimality equation for optimal policy selection for
each state defined in the system. The model is then utilized to analyze the
impact of various costs on the optimal policy. The MDP model is then applied to
two case studies to evaluate the performance of the model."
"Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is information describing threat vectors,
vulnerabilities, and attacks and is often used as training data for AI-based
cyber defense systems such as Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKG). There is a
strong need to develop community-accessible datasets to train existing AI-based
cybersecurity pipelines to efficiently and accurately extract meaningful
insights from CTI. We have created an initial unstructured CTI corpus from a
variety of open sources that we are using to train and test cybersecurity
entity models using the spaCy framework and exploring self-learning methods to
automatically recognize cybersecurity entities. We also describe methods to
apply cybersecurity domain entity linking with existing world knowledge from
Wikidata. Our future work will survey and test spaCy NLP tools and create
methods for continuous integration of new information extracted from text."
"This paper presents the results of a series of penetration tests performed on
the OpenStack Essex Cloud Management Software. Several different types of
penetration tests were performed including network protocol and command line
fuzzing, session hijacking and credential theft. Using these techniques
exploitable vulnerabilities were discovered that could enable an attacker to
gain access to restricted information contained on the OpenStack server, or to
gain full administrative privileges on the server. Key recommendations to
address these vulnerabilities are to use a secure protocol, such as HTTPS, for
communications between a cloud user and the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard, to
encrypt all files that store user or administrative login credentials, and to
correct a software bug found in the OpenStack Cinder typedelete command."
"We present ICAR, a mathematical framework derived from category theory for
representing cybersecurity NIST and MITRE's ontologies. Designed for
cybersecurity, ICAR is a category whose objects are cybersecurity knowledge
(weakness, vulnerability, impacted product, attack technique, etc.) and whose
morphisms are relations between this knowledge, that make sense for
cybersecurity. Within this rigorous and unified framework, we obtain a
knowledge graph capable of identifying the attack and weakness structures of an
IS, at the interface between description logics, database theory and
cybersecurity. We then define ten cybersecurity queries to help understand the
risks incurred by IS and organise their defence."
"Wireless Battery Management Systems (BMS) are increasingly being considered
for modern applications. The ever-increasing complexity and production costs of
BMS modules and wired connections resulted in a necessity for new ideas and
approaches. Despite this growing trend, there is a lack of generic solutions
focused on battery cells' sensor readout, where wireless communication allows
for a more flexible and cost-efficient sensor installation in battery packs.
Many wireless technologies, such as those that use the 2.4 GHz frequency band,
suffer from interference and other limitations. In this article, we present an
alternative approach to communication in BMS that relies on the use of Near
Field Communication (NFC) technology for battery sensor readouts. As an answer
to the rising concern over the counterfeited battery packs, we consider an
authentication schema for battery pack validation. We further consider security
measures for the processed and stored BMS status data. To show that a general
BMS application can make use of our design, we implement a BMS demonstrator
using the targeted components. We further test the demonstrator on the
technical and functional level, by also performing evaluation on its
performance, energy usage, and a security threat model."
"Business process management (BPM) and accompanying systems aim at enabling
enterprises to become adaptive. In spite of the dependency of enterprises on
secure business processes, BPM languages and techniques provide only little
support for security. Several complementary approaches have been proposed for
security in the domain of BPM. Nevertheless, support for a systematic procedure
for the development of secure electronic business processes is still missing.
In this paper, we pinpoint the need for a security engineering process model in
the domain of BPM and identify key requirements for such process model."
"Purpose. This paper examines the Internet security perception of Filipinos to
establish a need and sense of urgency on the part of the government to create a
culture of cybersecurity for every Filipino. Method. A quantitative survey was
conducted through traditional, online, and phone interviews among 252
respondents using a two-page questionnaire that covers basic demographic
information and two key elements (1) Internet usage and (2) security practices.
Results. Based on findings, there is a sharp increase in Internet users for the
last three years (50%), and most access to the Internet through mobile (94.4%).
Although at home is the most frequent location for Internet access (94.4%), a
good percentage still use free WiFi access points available in malls (22.2%),
restaurants (11.1%), and other public areas (38.9%) doing Internet services
(email and downloading) that are vulnerable to cyberattacks. The study also
revealed that although respondents may have good knowledge of Internet security
software, proper implementation is very limited. Conclusion. Filipinos are
susceptible to cyberattacks, particularly to phishing and malware attacks.
Also, the majority of the respondents' Internet security perception is
derivative: they practice online measures but with a limited understanding of
the purpose. Therefore proper education, through training and awareness, is an
effective approach to remedy the situation. Recommendations. The Philippine
government must now take actions and tap industries to educate Filipinos about
Internet security before any negative consequences happen in the future.
Research Implications. The information collected sets a clear picture of the
importance of cybersecurity awareness from a regional to a global perspective."
"The digital transformation has created a new digital space known as
cyberspace. This new cyberspace has improved the workings of businesses,
organizations, governments, society as a whole, and day to day life of an
individual. With these improvements come new challenges, and one of the main
challenges is security. The security of the new cyberspace is called
cybersecurity. Cyberspace has created new technologies and environments such as
cloud computing, smart devices, IoTs, and several others. To keep pace with
these advancements in cyber technologies there is a need to expand research and
develop new cybersecurity methods and tools to secure these domains and
environments. This book is an effort to introduce the reader to the field of
cybersecurity, highlight current issues and challenges, and provide future
directions to mitigate or resolve them. The main specializations of
cybersecurity covered in this book are software security, hardware security,
the evolution of malware, biometrics, cyber intelligence, and cyber forensics.
We must learn from the past, evolve our present and improve the future. Based
on this objective, the book covers the past, present, and future of these main
specializations of cybersecurity. The book also examines the upcoming areas of
research in cyber intelligence, such as hybrid augmented and explainable
artificial intelligence (AI). Human and AI collaboration can significantly
increase the performance of a cybersecurity system. Interpreting and explaining
machine learning models, i.e., explainable AI is an emerging field of study and
has a lot of potentials to improve the role of AI in cybersecurity."
"Cybersecurity has been a concern for quite a while now. In the latest years,
cyberattacks have been increasing in size and complexity, fueled by significant
advances in technology. Nowadays, there is an unavoidable necessity of
protecting systems and data crucial for business continuity. Hence, many
intrusion detection systems have been created in an attempt to mitigate these
threats and contribute to a timelier detection. This work proposes an
interpretable and explainable hybrid intrusion detection system, which makes
use of artificial intelligence methods to achieve better and more long-lasting
security. The system combines experts' written rules and dynamic knowledge
continuously generated by a decision tree algorithm as new shreds of evidence
emerge from network activity."
"There is an unprecedented increase in cybercrime globally observed over the
last years. One of the regions driving this increase is Africa, where
significant financial losses are reported. Yet, citizens of African countries
are not aware of the risks present in cyberspace. The design and implementation
of national awareness campaigns by African countries to address this problem
are in their infancy state, mainly due to the absence of capacity building
efforts. As part of the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre (GCSCC) programme,
we conducted a series of focus groups in six African countries, in order to
assess their cybersecurity posture, a critical component of which is user and
executive awareness of cyber risks. This paper is an extended version of
previous work where an initial analysis of awareness for cyber risk in African
countries was presented. In this extended version, we reflect on best practice
approaches for developing national awareness campaigns and use these as a
framework to analyse qualitative data from the focus groups. We discuss the
current state of African countries with regards to the implementation of
national cybersecurity awareness campaigns for. users and executives, the main
obstacles in combating cybercrime and conclude with recommendations on how
African countries can identify and prioritise activities to increase their
capacity regarding cybersecurity awareness."
"Gathering cyber threat intelligence from open sources is becoming
increasingly important for maintaining and achieving a high level of security
as systems become larger and more complex. However, these open sources are
often subject to information overload. It is therefore useful to apply machine
learning models that condense the amount of information to what is necessary.
Yet, previous studies and applications have shown that existing classifiers are
not able to extract specific information about emerging cybersecurity events
due to their low generalization ability. Therefore, we propose a system to
overcome this problem by training a new classifier for each new incident. Since
this requires a lot of labelled data using standard training methods, we
combine three different low-data regime techniques - transfer learning, data
augmentation, and few-shot learning - to train a high-quality classifier from
very few labelled instances. We evaluated our approach using a novel dataset
derived from the Microsoft Exchange Server data breach of 2021 which was
labelled by three experts. Our findings reveal an increase in F1 score of more
than 21 points compared to standard training methods and more than 18 points
compared to a state-of-the-art method in few-shot learning. Furthermore, the
classifier trained with this method and 32 instances is only less than 5 F1
score points worse than a classifier trained with 1800 instances."
"A core requirement for GDPR compliance is the maintenance of a register of
processing activities (ROPA). Our analysis of six ROPA templates from EU data
protection regulators shows the scope and granularity of a ROPA is subject to
widely varying guidance in different jurisdictions. We present a consolidated
data model based on common concepts and relationships across analysed
templates. We then analyse the extent of using the Data Privacy Vocabulary - a
vocabulary specification for GDPR. We show that the DPV currently does not
provide sufficient concepts to represent the ROPA data model and propose an
extension to fill this gap. This will enable creation of a pan-EU information
management framework for interoperability between organisations and regulators
for GDPR compliance."
"Homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology are regarded as two
significant technologies for improving e-voting systems. In this paper, we
suggest a novel e-voting system using homomorphic encryption and blockchain
technology that is focused on encrypting voter data. By encrypting voter
information rather than cast votes, the system enables various statistical
analyses regarding the vote result while securing the credibility, privacy, and
verifiability of overall e-voting system. We checked the efficiency of the
overall system by comparing the speed of the proposed system with the speed of
other e-voting systems that use homomorphic encryption and blockchain
technology."
"Fuzzing is utilized for testing software and systems for cybersecurity risk
via the automated adaptation of inputs. It facilitates the identification of
software bugs and misconfigurations that may create vulnerabilities, cause
abnormal operations or result in systems' failure. While many fuzzers have been
purpose-developed for testing specific systems, this paper proposes a
generalized fuzzer that provides a specific capability for testing software and
cyber-physical systems which utilize configuration files. While this fuzzer
facilitates the detection of system and software defects and vulnerabilities,
it also facilitates the determination of the impact of settings on device
operations. This later capability facilitates the modeling of the devices in a
cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis system. This paper describes and
assesses the performance of the proposed fuzzer technology. It also details how
the fuzzer operates as part of the broader cybersecurity risk assessment and
analysis system."
"Cybersecurity is essential for the protection of companies against cyber
threats. Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company's
capabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider
such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself
(DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC,
implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to
adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and
recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and
encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT
in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer
insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective
automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB's hands-on skills,
tools adaptedness, and the users' willingness to documenting confidential
information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing
them to understand what they do. An SMB's motivation to improve security
depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the
SMB's business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate
that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption. The final

"Traffic inspection is a fundamental building block of many security solutions
today. For example, to prevent the leakage or exfiltration of confidential
insider information, as well as to block malicious traffic from entering the
network, most enterprises today operate intrusion detection and prevention
systems that inspect traffic. However, the state-of-the-art inspection systems
do not reflect well the interests of the different involved autonomous roles.
For example, employees in an enterprise, or a company outsourcing its network
management to a specialized third party, may require that their traffic remains
confidential, even from the system administrator. Moreover, the rules used by
the intrusion detection system, or more generally the configuration of an
online or offline anomaly detection engine, may be provided by a third party,
e.g., a security research firm, and can hence constitute a critical business
asset which should be kept confidential. Today, it is often believed that
accounting for these additional requirements is impossible, as they contradict
efficiency and effectiveness. We in this paper explore a novel approach, called
Privacy Preserving Inspection (PRI), which provides a solution to this problem,
by preserving privacy of traffic inspection and confidentiality of inspection
rules and configurations, and e.g., also supports the flexible installation of
additional Data Leak Prevention (DLP) rules specific to the company."
"Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a
smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating
heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection
services. While a service oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT
and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture
to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS
system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized
authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure.
Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper
proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for
Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a
microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access
control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services are decoupled
into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart
contract, and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive
experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a
decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to
distributed IoT based SPS system."
"Like most advances, wireless LAN poses both opportunities and risks. The
evolution of wireless networking in recent years has raised many serious
security issues. These security issues are of great concern for this technology
as it is being subjected to numerous attacks. Because of the free-space radio
transmission in wireless networks, eavesdropping becomes easy and consequently
a security breach may result in unauthorized access, information theft,
interference and service degradation. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have
emerged as an important solution to security threats surrounding the use of
public networks for private communications. While VPNs for wired line networks
have matured in both research and commercial environments, the design and
deployment of VPNs for WLAN is still an evolving field. This paper presents an
approach to secure IEEE 802.11g WLAN using OpenVPN, a transport layer VPN
solution and its impact on performance of IEEE 802.11g WLAN."
"The introduction of point of sales POS technologies as a payment system was
welcoming and constitutes one of the major breakthroughs in the efforts made to
rejuvenate the global financial systems. However, like other information
technology IT based financial systems, the POS also poses some cybersecurity
security threats. The unique thing about the POS is that the main cybersecurity
threats it poses to most users are not IT based which refers to unauthorized
access and gaining information without the knowledge of the user. The threats
are rather connected to the mode of operation of POS kiosks, particularly as
experienced in most parts of Nigeria. The mode of operation exposes users cards
to possible cloning."
"Deep Learning (DL)-based malware detectors are increasingly adopted for early
detection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity. However, their sensitivity to
adversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating
such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the
resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given
rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware
example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware
variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within
AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box
methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with
the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most
malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating
non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice
due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal
language model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to
malware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte
sequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed
method, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a
real-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\%
evasion rate. MalGPT enables cybersecurity researchers to develop advanced
defense capabilities by emulating large-scale realistic AMG."
"Although sufficient authentication mechanisms were enhanced by the use of two
or more factors that resulted in new multi factor authentication schemes, more
sophisticated and targeted attacks have shown they are also vulnerable. This
research work proposes a novel two factor authentication system that
incorporates honeytokens into the two factor authentication process. The
current implementation collaborates with Google authenticator. The novelty and
simplicity of the presented approach aims at providing additional layers of
security and protection into a system and thus making it more secure through a
stronger and more efficient authentication mechanism."
"As the digital world evolves, so do the threats to our security do too.
Keyloggers were once a large threat to the cyber world. Though undergoing many
transformations alongside the technological advancements of today, it is
important to raise questions about the importance of Anti-Keyloggers in our
current state of cyber security. This survey dives into the historical
evolution of Keyloggers and investigates their current day forms. Within this
inspection of Keyloggers, we must propose whether Anti-Keyloggers serve a
purpose to this ever-changing landscape before us or if emerging strategies
have rendered them obsolete."
"ChatGPT is a generative pretrained transformer language model created using
artificial intelligence implemented as chatbot which can provide very detailed
responses to a wide variety of questions. As a very contemporary phenomenon,
this tool has a wide variety of potential use cases that have yet to be
explored. With the significant extent of information on a broad assortment of
potential topics, ChatGPT could add value to many information security uses
cases both from an efficiency perspective as well as to offer another source of
security information that could be used to assist with securing Internet
accessible assets of organizations. One information security practice that
could benefit from ChatGPT is the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing.
This research uses a case study methodology to explore and investigate the uses
of ChatGPT in obtaining valuable reconnaissance data. ChatGPT is able to
provide many types of intel regarding targeted properties which includes
Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges, domain names, network topology, vendor
technologies, SSL/TLS ciphers, ports & services, and operating systems used by
the target. The reconnaissance information can then be used during the planning
phase of a penetration test to determine the tactics, tools, and techniques to
guide the later phases of the penetration test in order to discover potential
risks such as unpatched software components and security misconfiguration
related issues. The study provides insights into how artificial intelligence
language models can be used in cybersecurity and contributes to the advancement
of penetration testing techniques.

"The emergence of AI tools in cybersecurity creates many opportunities and
uncertainties. A focus group with advanced graduate students in cybersecurity
revealed the potential depth and breadth of the challenges and opportunities.
The salient issues are access to open source or free tools, documentation,
curricular diversity, and clear articulation of ethical principles for AI
cybersecurity education. Confronting the ""black box"" mentality in AI
cybersecurity work is also of the greatest importance, doubled by deeper and
prior education in foundational AI work. Systems thinking and effective
communication were considered relevant areas of educational improvement. Future
AI educators and practitioners need to address these issues by implementing
rigorous technical training curricula, clear documentation, and frameworks for
ethically monitoring AI combined with critical and system's thinking and
communication skills."
"We consider the future cyber security of industrial control systems. As best
as we can see, much of this future unfolds in the context of the Internet of
Things (IoT). In fact, we envision that all industrial and infrastructure
environments, and cyber-physical systems in general, will take the form
reminiscent of what today is referred to as the IoT. IoT is envisioned as
multitude of heterogeneous devices densely interconnected and communicating
with the objective of accomplishing a diverse range of objectives, often
collaboratively. One can argue that in the relatively near future, the IoT
construct will subsume industrial plants, infrastructures, housing and other
systems that today are controlled by ICS and SCADA systems. In the IoT
environments, cybersecurity will derive largely from system agility,
moving-target defenses, cybermaneuvering, and other autonomous or
semi-autonomous behaviors. Cyber security of IoT may also benefit from new
design methods for mixed-trusted systems; and from big data analytics --
predictive and autonomous."
"Web-based phishing attacks nowadays exploit popular cloud web hosting
services and apps such as Google Sites and Typeform for hosting their attacks.
Since these attacks originate from reputable domains and IP addresses of the
cloud services, traditional phishing detection methods such as IP reputation
monitoring and blacklisting are not very effective. Here we investigate the
effectiveness of deep learning models in detecting this class of cloud-based
phishing attacks. Specifically, we evaluate deep learning models for three
phishing detection methods--LSTM model for URL analysis, YOLOv2 model for logo
analysis, and triplet network model for visual similarity analysis. We train
the models using well-known datasets and test their performance on cloud-based
phishing attacks in the wild. Our results qualitatively explain why the models
succeed or fail. Furthermore, our results highlight how combining results from
the individual models can improve the effectiveness of detecting cloud-based
phishing attacks."
"The increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
led to growing concerns about their safety, security risks, and ethical
implications. This paper aims to provide an overview of the different types of
security risks associated with ChatGPT, including malicious text and code
generation, private data disclosure, fraudulent services, information
gathering, and producing unethical content. We present an empirical study
examining the effectiveness of ChatGPT's content filters and explore potential
ways to bypass these safeguards, demonstrating the ethical implications and
security risks that persist in LLMs even when protections are in place. Based
on a qualitative analysis of the security implications, we discuss potential
strategies to mitigate these risks and inform researchers, policymakers, and
industry professionals about the complex security challenges posed by LLMs like
ChatGPT. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the ethical and
security implications of LLMs, underscoring the need for continued research in
this area."
"Despite all visible dividers, the Internet is getting us closer and closer,
but with a great price. Our security is the price. The international community
is fully aware of the urgent need to secure the cyberspace as you see the
multiplication of security standards and national schemes interpreting them
beyond borders: ISO 15408, ISO 17799, and ISO 27001. Even though some
countries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their
security books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of
security as long as they share their networks with entities of less security.
The standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the
development of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders
have to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the
partnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the
continuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and
certification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the
partnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic
society. In order to clean our society from cyber crimes and cyber terrorism we
need to impose strict security policies and enforce them in a cooperative
manner. The paper discusses a country's effort in the development of a national
security strategy given its security economic intelligence position, its
security readiness, and its adverse exposure."
"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to solve
cybersecurity problems has been gaining traction within industry and academia,
in part as a response to widespread malware attacks on critical systems, such
as cloud infrastructures, government offices or hospitals, and the vast amounts
of data they generate. AI- and ML-assisted cybersecurity offers data-driven
automation that could enable security systems to identify and respond to cyber
threats in real time. However, there is currently a shortfall of professionals
trained in AI and ML for cybersecurity. Here we address the shortfall by
developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate and graduate
students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in applying AI and ML
techniques to real-world datasets to learn about Cyber Threat Intelligence
(CTI), malware analysis, and classification, among other important topics in
cybersecurity.
  Here we describe six self-contained and adaptive modules in ""AI-assisted
Malware Analysis."" Topics include: (1) CTI and malware attack stages, (2)
malware knowledge representation and CTI sharing, (3) malware data collection
and feature identification, (4) AI-assisted malware detection, (5) malware
classification and attribution, and (6) advanced malware research topics and
case studies such as adversarial learning and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
detection."
"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are pivotal in the global economy,
accounting for over 90% of businesses and 60% of employment worldwide. Despite
their significance, SMEs have been disregarded from cybersecurity initiatives,
rendering them ill-equipped to deal with the growing frequency, sophistication,
and destructiveness of cyber-attacks. We systematically reviewed the
cybersecurity literature on SMEs published between 2017 and 2023.
  We focus on research discussing cyber threats, adopted controls, challenges,
and constraints SMEs face in pursuing cybersecurity resilience.
  Our search yielded 916 studies that we narrowed to 77 relevant papers. We
identified 44 unique themes and categorised them as novel findings or
established knowledge. This distinction revealed that research on SMEs is
shallow and has made little progress in understanding SMEs' roles, threats, and
needs. Studies often repeated early discoveries without replicating or offering
new insights.
  The existing research indicates that the main challenges to attaining
cybersecurity resilience of SMEs are a lack of awareness of the cybersecurity
risks, limited cybersecurity literacy and constrained financial resources.
However, resource availability varied between developed and developing
countries. Our analysis indicated a relationship among these themes, suggesting
that limited literacy is the root cause of awareness and resource constraint
issues."
"Controller Area Network (CAN) is an essential networking protocol that
connects multiple electronic control units (ECUs) in a vehicle. However,
CAN-based in-vehicle networks (IVNs) face security risks owing to the CAN
mechanisms. An adversary can sabotage a vehicle by leveraging the security
risks if they can access the CAN bus. Thus, recent actions and cybersecurity
regulations (e.g., UNR 155) require carmakers to implement intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) in their vehicles. An IDS should detect cyberattacks and provide
a forensic capability to analyze attacks. Although many IDSs have been
proposed, considerations regarding their feasibility and explainability remain
lacking. This study proposes X-CANIDS, which is a novel IDS for CAN-based IVNs.
X-CANIDS dissects the payloads in CAN messages into human-understandable
signals using a CAN database. The signals improve the intrusion detection
performance compared with the use of bit representations of raw payloads. These
signals also enable an understanding of which signal or ECU is under attack.
X-CANIDS can detect zero-day attacks because it does not require any labeled
dataset in the training phase. We confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
method through a benchmark test on an automotive-grade embedded device with a
GPU. The results of this work will be valuable to carmakers and researchers
considering the installation of in-vehicle IDSs for their vehicles."
"Cyber security is one of the burning issues in modern world. Increased IT
infrastructure has given rise to enormous chances of security breach.
Bangladesh being a relatively new member of cyber security arena has its own
demand and appeal. Digitalization is happening in Bangladesh for last few years
at an appreciable rate. People are being connected to the worldwide web
community with their smart devices. These devices have their own vulnerability
issues as well as the data shared over the internet has a very good chances of
getting breached. Common vulnerability issues like infecting the device with
malware, Trojan, virus are on the rise. Moreover, a lack of proper cyber
security policy and strategy might make the existing situation at the
vulnerable edge of tipping point. Hence the upcoming new infrastructures will
be at a greater risk if the issues are not dealt with at an early age. In this
paper common vulnerability issues including their recent attacks on cyber space
of Bangladesh, cyber security strategy and need for data privacy policy is
discussed and analysed briefly."
"Over the past few years, we have seen several cyber incidents being reported,
where some of the primary causes were the lack of proper security controls
onboard the ship and crew awareness on cybersecurity. In response to the
growing cyber threat landscape in the maritime sector, we have developed a set
of guidelines for maritime cyber risk management, focusing on four major
shipboard Operational Technology (OT) systems that are crucial for the
day-to-day operation of ships. These four OT systems are: Communication
Systems, Propulsion, Machinery and Power Control Systems, Navigation Systems
and Cargo Management Systems. The guidelines identify the cyber risks in each
of the OT systems and recommend the necessary actions that can be taken to
manage risks in each shipboard OT system. In this paper, we introduce the new
guidelines, which include cyber risks, mitigation measures, cyber risk
assessment, and a checklist to help shipowners and maritime authorities assess
and enhance cyber hygiene of their vessels. Our guidelines have been
disseminated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to owners
and operators of the Singapore Registry of Ships for their reference and use."
"Blockchain has empowered computer systems to be more secure using a
distributed network. However, the current blockchain design suffers from
fairness issues in transaction ordering. Miners are able to reorder
transactions to generate profits, the so-called miner extractable value (MEV).
Existing research recognizes MEV as a severe security issue and proposes
potential solutions, including prominent Flashbots. However, previous studies
have mostly analyzed blockchain data, which might not capture the impacts of
MEV in a much broader AI society. Thus, in this research, we applied natural
language processing (NLP) methods to comprehensively analyze topics in tweets
on MEV. We collected more than 20000 tweets with #MEV and #Flashbots hashtags
and analyzed their topics. Our results show that the tweets discussed profound
topics of ethical concern, including security, equity, emotional sentiments,
and the desire for solutions to MEV. We also identify the co-movements of MEV
activities on blockchain and social media platforms. Our study contributes to
the literature at the interface of blockchain security, MEV solutions, and AI
ethics."
"The increasing critical dependencies on Internetof-Things (IoT) have raised
security concerns; its application on the critical infrastructures (CIs) for
power generation has come under massive cyber-attack over the years. Prior
research efforts to understand cybersecurity from Cyber Situational Awareness
(CSA) perspective fail to critically consider the various Cyber Situational
Awareness (CSA) security vulnerabilities from a human behavioural perspective
in line with the CI. This study evaluates CSA elements to predict cyber-attacks
in the power generation sector. Data for this research article was collected
from IPPs using the survey method. The analysis method was employed through
Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess the
proposed model. The results revealed negative effects on people and
cyber-attack, but significant in predicting cyber-attacks. The study also
indicated that information handling is significant and positively influences
cyber-attack. The study also reveals no mediation effect between the
association of People and Attack and Information and Attack. It could result
from an effective cyber security control implemented by the IPPs. Finally, the
study also shows no sign of network infrastructure cyber-attack predictions.
The reasons could be because managers of IPPs had adequate access policies and
security measures in place."
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in Metaverse
environments to generate dynamic and realistic content and to control the
behavior of non-player characters (NPCs). However, the cybersecurity concerns
associated with LLMs have become increasingly prominent. Previous research has
primarily focused on patching system vulnerabilities to enhance cybersecurity,
but these approaches are not well-suited to the Metaverse, where the virtual
space is more complex, LLMs are vulnerable, and ethical user interaction is
critical. Moreover, the scope of cybersecurity in the Metaverse is expected to
expand significantly. This paper proposes a method for enhancing cybersecurity
through the simulation of user interaction with LLMs. Our goal is to educate
users and strengthen their defense capabilities through exposure to a
comprehensive simulation system. This system includes extensive Metaverse
cybersecurity Q&A and attack simulation scenarios. By engaging with these,
users will improve their ability to recognize and withstand risks.
Additionally, to address the ethical implications of user input, we propose
using LLMs as evaluators to assess user content across five dimensions. We
further adapt the models through vocabulary expansion training to better
understand personalized inputs and emoticons. We conduct experiments on
multiple LLMs and find that our approach is effective."
"Technological advances in the telecommunications industry have brought
significant advantages in the management and performance of communication
networks. The railway industry is among the ones that have benefited the most.
These interconnected systems, however, have a wide area exposed to
cyberattacks. This survey examines the cybersecurity aspects of railway systems
by considering the standards, guidelines, frameworks, and technologies used in
the industry to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks, particularly regarding
the relationship between safety and security. To do so, we dedicate specific
attention to signaling, which fundamental reliance on computer and
communication technologies allows us to explore better the multifaceted nature
of the security of modern hyperconnected railway systems. With this in mind, we
then move on to analyzing the approaches and tools that practitioners can use
to facilitate the cyber security process. In detail, we present a view on cyber
ranges as an enabling technology to model and emulate computer networks and
attack-defense scenarios, study vulnerabilities' impact, and finally devise
countermeasures. We also discuss several possible use cases strongly connected
to the railway industry reality."
"A major security challenge for modern Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is
to ensure that the devices run legitimate firmware free from malware. This
challenge can be addressed through a security primitive called attestation
which allows a remote backend to verify the firmware integrity of the devices
it manages. In order to accelerate broad attestation adoption in the IoT domain
the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has introduced the Device Identifier
Composition Engine (DICE) series of specifications. DICE is a hardware-software
architecture for constrained, e.g., microcontroller-based IoT devices where the
firmware is divided into successively executed layers.
  In this paper, we demonstrate a remote Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU)
attack on DICE-based attestation. We demonstrate that it is possible to install
persistent malware in the flash memory of a constrained microcontroller that
cannot be detected through DICE-based attestation. The main idea of our attack
is to install malware during runtime of application logic in the top firmware
layer. The malware reads the valid attestation key and stores it on the
device's flash memory. After reboot, the malware uses the previously stored key
for all subsequent attestations to the backend. We conduct the installation of
malware and copying of the key through Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). As a
platform for our demonstration, we use the Cortex-M-based nRF52840
microcontroller. We provide a discussion of several possible countermeasures
which can mitigate the shortcomings of the DICE specifications."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits across sectors, yet
also poses risks from dual-use potentials, biases, and unintended behaviors.
This paper reviews emerging issues with opaque and uncontrollable AI systems
and proposes an integrative framework called violet teaming to develop reliable
and responsible AI. Violet teaming combines adversarial vulnerability probing
(red teaming) with solutions for safety and security (blue teaming) while
prioritizing ethics and social benefit. It emerged from AI safety research to
manage risks proactively by design. The paper traces the evolution of red,
blue, and purple teaming toward violet teaming, and then discusses applying
violet techniques to address biosecurity risks of AI in biotechnology.
Additional sections review key perspectives across law, ethics, cybersecurity,
macrostrategy, and industry best practices essential for operationalizing
responsible AI through holistic technical and social considerations. Violet
teaming provides both philosophy and method for steering AI trajectories toward
societal good. With conscience and wisdom, the extraordinary capabilities of AI
can enrich humanity. But without adequate precaution, the risks could prove
catastrophic. Violet teaming aims to empower moral technology for the common
welfare."
"As organizations increasingly use cloud services to host their IT
infrastructure, there is a need to share data among these cloud hosted services
and systems. A majority of IT organizations have workloads spread across
different cloud service providers, growing their multi-cloud environments. When
an organization grows their multi-cloud environment, the threat vectors and
vulnerabilities for their cloud systems and services grow as well. The increase
in the number of attack vectors creates a challenge of how to prioritize
mitigations and countermeasures to best defend a multi-cloud environment
against attacks. Utilizing multiple industry standard risk analysis tools, we
conducted an analysis of multi-cloud threat vectors enabling calculation and
prioritization for the identified mitigations and countermeasures. The
prioritizations from the analysis showed that authentication and architecture
are the highest risk areas of threat vectors. Armed with this data, IT managers
are able to more appropriately budget cybersecurity expenditure to implement
the most impactful mitigations and countermeasures."
"Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different
types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, spams, and botnets. To reduce
the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in traditional
security mechanisms like anti-virus and anti-spam software, sometimes also
known as \emph{self-defense} mechanisms. However, according to security
experts, such software (and their subsequent advancements) will not completely
eliminate risk. Recent research efforts have considered the problem of residual
risk elimination by proposing the idea of \emph{cyber-insurance}. In this
regard, an important research problem is resolving information asymmetry issues
associated with cyber-insurance contracts. In this paper we propose
\emph{three} mechanisms to resolve information asymmetry in cyber-insurance.
Our mechanisms are based on the \emph{Principal-Agent} (PA) model in
microeconomic theory. We show that (1) optimal cyber-insurance contracts
induced by our mechanisms only provide partial coverage to the insureds. This
ensures greater self-defense efforts on the part of the latter to protect their
computing systems, which in turn increases overall network security, (2) the
level of deductible per network user contract increases in a concave manner
with the topological degree of the user, and (3) a market for cyber-insurance
can be made to exist in the presence of monopolistic insurers under effective
mechanism design. Our methodology is applicable to any distributed network
scenario in which a framework for cyber-insurance can be implemented."
"We study the impact of data sharing policies on cyber insurance markets.
These policies have been proposed to address the scarcity of data about cyber
threats, which is essential to manage cyber risks. We propose a Cournot duopoly
competition model in which two insurers choose the number of policies they
offer (i.e., their production level) and also the resources they invest to
ensure the quality of data regarding the cost of claims (i.e., the data quality
of their production cost). We find that enacting mandatory data sharing
sometimes creates situations in which at most one of the two insurers invests
in data quality, whereas both insurers would invest when information sharing is
not mandatory. This raises concerns about the merits of making data sharing
mandatory."
"Cyber risk is an omnipresent risk in the increasingly digitized world that is
known to be difficult to manage. This paper proposes a two-pillar cyber risk
management framework to address such difficulty. The first pillar, cyber risk
assessment, blends the frequency-severity model in insurance with the cascade
model in cybersecurity, to capture the unique feature of cyber risk. The second
pillar, cyber capital management, provides informative decision-making on a
balanced cyber risk management strategy, which includes cybersecurity
investments, insurance coverage, and reserves. This framework is demonstrated
by a case study based on a historical cyber incident dataset, which shows that
a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is necessary for a budget-constrained
company with competing objectives for cyber risk management. Sensitivity
analysis also illustrates that the best strategy depends on various factors,
such as the amount of cybersecurity investments and the effectiveness of
cybersecurity controls."
"Cybersecurity governance influences the quality of strategic decision-making
to ensure cyber risks are managed effectively. Board of Directors are the
decisions-makers held accountable for managing this risk; however, they lack
adequate and efficient information necessary for making such decisions. In
addition to the myriad of challenges they face, they are often insufficiently
versed in the technology or cybersecurity terminology or not provided with the
correct tools to support them to make sound decisions to govern cybersecurity
effectively. A different approach is needed to ensure BoDs are clear on the
approach the business is taking to build a cyber resilient organization. This
systematic literature review investigates the existing risk measurement
instruments, cybersecurity metrics, and associated models for supporting BoDs.
We identified seven conceptual themes through literature analysis that form the
basis of this study's main contribution. The findings showed that, although
sophisticated cybersecurity tools exist and are developing, there is limited
information for Board of Directors to support them in terms of metrics and
models to govern cybersecurity in a language they understand. The review also
provides some recommendations on theories and models that can be further
investigated to provide support to Board of Directors."
"Phishing websites distribute unsolicited content and are frequently used to
commit email and internet fraud; detecting them before any user information is
submitted is critical. Several efforts have been made to detect these phishing
websites in recent years. Most existing approaches use hand-crafted lexical and
statistical features from a website's textual content to train classification
models to detect phishing web pages. However, these phishing detection
approaches have a few challenges, including 1) the tediousness of extracting
hand-crafted features, which require specialized domain knowledge to determine
which features are useful for a particular platform; and 2) the difficulties
encountered by models built on hand-crafted features to capture the semantic
patterns in words and characters in URL and HTML content. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes WebPhish, an end-to-end deep neural network
trained using embedded raw URLs and HTML content to detect website phishing
attacks. First, the proposed model automatically employs an embedding technique
to extract the corresponding characters into homologous dense vectors. Then,
the concatenation layer merges the URL and HTML embedding matrices. Following
that, Convolutional layers are used to model its semantic dependencies.
Extensive experiments were conducted with real-world phishing data, which
yielded an accuracy of 98.1\%, showing that WebPhish outperforms baseline
detection approaches in identifying phishing pages."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have become the weak spot of our
economy for cyber attacks. These companies are large in number and often do not
have the controls in place to prevent successful attacks, respectively are not
prepared to systematically manage their cybersecurity capabilities. One of the
reasons for why many SME do not adopt cybersecurity is that developers of
cybersecurity solutions understand little the SME context and the requirements
for successful use of these solutions. We elicit requirements by studying how
cybersecurity experts provide advice to SME. The experts recommendations offer
insights into what important capabilities of the solution are and how these
capabilities ought to be used for mitigating cybersecurity threats. The
adoption of a recommendation hints at a correct match of the solution, hence
successful consideration of requirements. Abandoned recommendations point to a
misalignment that can be used as a source to inquire missed requirements.
Re-occurrence of adoption or abandonment decisions corroborate the presence of
requirements. This poster describes the challenges of SME regarding
cybersecurity and introduces our proposed approach to elicit requirements for
cybersecurity solutions. The poster describes CYSEC, our tool used to capture
cybersecurity advice and help to scale cybersecurity requirements elicitation
to a large number of participating SME. We conclude by outlining the planned
research to develop and validate CYSEC."
"Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly becoming universal. The success
of IoT cannot be ignored in the scenario today, along with its attacks and
threats on IoT devices and facilities are also increasing day by day. Cyber
attacks become a part of IoT and affecting the life and society of users, so
steps must be taken to defend cyber seriously. Cybercrimes threaten the
infrastructure of governments and businesses globally and can damage the users
in innumerable ways. With the global cybercrime damages predicted to cost up to
6 trillion dollars annually on the global economy by cyber crime. Estimated of
328 Million Dollar annual losses with the cyber attacks in Australia itself.
Various steps are taken to slow down these attacks but unfortunately not able
to achieve success properly. Therefor secure IoT is the need of this time and
understanding of attacks and threats in IoT structure should be studied. The
reasons for cyber-attacks can be Countries having week cyber securities,
Cybercriminals use new technologies to attack, Cybercrime is possible with
services and other business schemes. MSP (Managed Service Providers) face
different difficulties in fighting with Cyber-crime. They have to ensure that
security of the customer as well as their security in terms of their servers,
devices, and systems. Hence, they must use effective, fast, and easily usable
antivirus and antimalware tools."
"The escalating digitalisation of our lives and enterprises has led to a
parallel growth in the complexity and frequency of cyber-attacks. Small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in Australia, are experiencing
increased vulnerability to cyber threats, posing a significant challenge to the
nation's cyber security landscape. Embracing transformative technologies such
as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) can potentially strengthen cyber security policies for Australian
SMEs. However, their practical application, advantages, and limitations remain
underexplored, with prior research mainly focusing on large corporations. This
study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of
the potential role of LLMs in enhancing cyber security policies for Australian
SMEs. Employing a mixed-methods study design, this research includes a
literature review, qualitative analysis of SME case studies, and a quantitative
assessment of LLM performance metrics in cyber security applications. The
findings highlight the promising potential of LLMs across various performance
criteria, including relevance, accuracy, and applicability, though gaps remain
in areas such as completeness and clarity. The study underlines the importance
of integrating human expertise with LLM technology and refining model
development to address these limitations. By proposing a robust conceptual
framework guiding the effective adoption of LLMs, this research aims to
contribute to a safer and more resilient cyber environment for Australian SMEs,
enabling sustainable growth and competitiveness in the digital era."
"In recent years blockchain technology has received tremendous attention.
Blockchain users are known by a changeable Public Key (PK) that introduces a
level of anonymity, however, studies have shown that anonymized transactions
can be linked to deanonymize the users. Most of the existing studies on user
de-anonymization focus on monetary applications, however, blockchain has
received extensive attention in non-monetary applications like IoT. In this
paper we study the impact of de-anonymization on IoT-based blockchain. We
populate a blockchain with data of smart home devices and then apply machine
learning algorithms in an attempt to classify transactions to a particular
device that in turn risks the privacy of the users. Two types of attack models
are defined: (i) informed attacks: where attackers know the type of devices
installed in a smart home, and (ii) blind attacks: where attackers do not have
this information. We show that machine learning algorithms can successfully
classify the transactions with 90% accuracy. To enhance the anonymity of the
users, we introduce multiple obfuscation methods which include combining
multiple packets into a transaction, merging ledgers of multiple devices, and
delaying transactions. The implementation results show that these obfuscation
methods significantly reduce the attack success rates to 20% to 30% and thus
enhance user privacy."
"Although many Computer Science (CS) programs offer cybersecurity courses,
they are typically optional and placed at the periphery of the program. We
advocate to integrate cybersecurity as a crosscutting concept in CS curricula,
which is also consistent with latest cybersecurity curricular guidelines, e.g.,
CSEC2017. We describe our experience of implementing this crosscutting
intervention across three undergraduate core CS courses at a leading technical
university in Europe between 2018 and 2023, collectively educating over 2200
students. The security education was incorporated within CS courses using a
partnership between the responsible course instructor and a security expert,
i.e., the security expert (after consultation with course instructors)
developed and taught lectures covering multiple CSEC2017 knowledge areas. This
created a complex dynamic between three stakeholders: the course instructor,
the security expert, and the students. We reflect on our intervention from the
perspective of the three stakeholders -- we conducted a post-course survey to
collect student perceptions, and semi-supervised interviews with responsible
course instructors and the security expert to gauge their experience. We found
that while the students were extremely enthusiastic about the security content
and retained its impact several years later, the misaligned incentives for the
instructors and the security expert made it difficult to sustain this
intervention without organizational support. By identifying limitations in our
intervention, we suggest ideas for sustaining it."
"The advancement and the proliferation of information systems among
enterprises have given rise to understanding cybersecurity. Cybersecurity
practices provide a set of techniques and procedures to protect the systems,
networks, programs and data from attack, damage, or unauthorised access. Such
cybersecurity practices vary and are applied differently to different types of
enterprises. The purpose of this research is to compare the critical
cybersecurity threats and practices in the cloud context among micro, small,
and medium enterprises. By conducting a survey among 289 micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises in Australia, this study highlights the significant
differences in their cloud security practices. It also concludes that future
studies that focus on cybersecurity issues and practices in the context of
cloud computing should pay attention to these differences."
"This survey presents a comprehensive review of current literature on
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods for cyber security
applications. Due to the rapid development of Internet-connected systems and
Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the
fields of cyber security including intrusion detection, malware detection, and
spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for
the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and
efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber
security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are
deployed in the black-box manner, meaning that security experts and customers
are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The
deficiencies of transparency and interpretability of existing Artificial
Intelligence techniques would decrease human users' confidence in the models
utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current
situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated.
Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security
models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and
allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of
cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial
Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on
applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and
criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey
research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security."
"This chapter explores the complex realm of autonomous cars, analyzing their
fundamental components and operational characteristics. The initial phase of
the discussion is elucidating the internal mechanics of these automobiles,
encompassing the crucial involvement of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI)
identification systems, control mechanisms, and their integration with
cloud-based servers within the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT). It
delves into practical implementations of autonomous cars, emphasizing their
utilization in forecasting traffic patterns and transforming the dynamics of
transportation. The text also explores the topic of Robotic Process Automation
(RPA), illustrating the impact of autonomous cars on different businesses
through the automation of tasks. The primary focus of this investigation lies
in the realm of cybersecurity, specifically in the context of autonomous
vehicles. A comprehensive analysis will be conducted to explore various risk
management solutions aimed at protecting these vehicles from potential threats
including ethical, environmental, legal, professional, and social dimensions,
offering a comprehensive perspective on their societal implications. A
strategic plan for addressing the challenges and proposing strategies for
effectively traversing the complex terrain of autonomous car systems,
cybersecurity, hazards, and other concerns are some resources for acquiring an
understanding of the intricate realm of autonomous cars and their ramifications
in contemporary society, supported by a comprehensive compilation of resources
for additional investigation.

"This paper compares the risk factors for becoming a victim of two types of
phishing: high-tech phishing (using malicious software) and low-tech phishing
(using e-mails and telephone calls). These risk factors are linked to
possibilities for situational crime prevention. Data from a cybercrime victim
survey in the Netherlands (n=10,316) is used. Based on routine activity theory,
the multivariate analyses include thirty variables. The findings show
situational crime prevention has to be aimed at groups other than just the
users themselves. Criminals are primarily interested in popular online places
and the onus is on the owners of these virtual places to protect their visitors
from getting infected."
"In cybersecurity it is often the case that malicious or anomalous activity
can only be detected by combining many weak indicators of compromise, any one
of which may not raise suspicion when taken alone. The path that such
indicators take can also be critical. This makes the problem of analysing
cybersecurity data particularly well suited to Topological Data Analysis (TDA),
a field that studies the high level structure of data using techniques from
algebraic topology, both for exploratory analysis and as part of a machine
learning workflow. By introducing TDA and reviewing the work done on its
application to cybersecurity, we hope to highlight to researchers a promising
new area with strong potential to improve cybersecurity data science."
"Product safety has been a concern in Europe ever since the early 1960s.
Despite the long and relatively stable historical lineage of product safety
regulations, new technologies, changes in the world economy, and other major
transformations have in recent years brought product safety again to the
forefront of policy debates. As reforms are also underway, there is a
motivation to review the complex safety policy framework in the European Union
(EU). Thus, building on deliberative policy analysis and interpretative
literature review, this paper reviews the safety policy for non-food consumer
products in the EU. The review covers the historical background and the main
laws, administration and enforcement, standardization and harmonization, laws
enacted for specific products, notifications delivered by national safety
authorities, recalls of dangerous products, and the liability of these. Based
on the review and analysis of these themes and the associated literature, some
current policy challenges are further discussed."
"Quantum Internet signifies a remarkable advancement in communication
technology, harnessing the principles of quantum entanglement and superposition
to facilitate unparalleled levels of security and efficient computations.
Quantum communication can be achieved through the utilization of quantum
entanglement. Through the exchange of entangled pairs between two entities,
quantum communication becomes feasible, enabled by the process of quantum
teleportation. Given the lossy nature of the channels and the exponential
decoherence of the transmitted photons, a set of intermediate nodes can serve
as quantum repeaters to perform entanglement swapping and directly entangle two
distant nodes. Such quantum repeaters may be malicious and by setting up
malicious entanglements, intermediate nodes can jeopardize the confidentiality
of the quantum information exchanged between the two communication nodes.
Hence, this paper proposes a quantum identity authentication protocol that
protects quantum networks from malicious entanglements. Unlike the existing
protocols, the proposed quantum authentication protocol does not require
periodic refreshments of the shared secret keys. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed protocol can detect malicious entanglements with a 100%
probability after an average of 4 authentication rounds."
"This paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of quantum computing on
the security of 5G mobile telecommunications. This involves considering how
cryptography is used in 5G, and how the security of the system would be
affected by the advent of quantum computing. This leads naturally to the
specification of a series of simple, phased, recommended changes intended to
ensure that the security of 5G (as well as 3G and 4G) is not badly damaged if
and when large scale quantum computing becomes a practical reality. By
exploiting backwards-compatibility features of the 5G security system design,
we are able to propose a novel multi-phase approach to upgrading security that
allows for a simple and smooth migration to a post-quantum-secure system."
"The explosive growth of cyber attacks nowadays, such as malware, spam, and
intrusions, caused severe consequences on society. Securing cyberspace has
become an utmost concern for organizations and governments. Traditional Machine
Learning (ML) based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats,
but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In
recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many
researchers investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between
cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize
existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future
studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this paper, we provide a
comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview
of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general
process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for
different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods
and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their
modeling. Furthermore, we collect open datasets and toolkits for graph-based
cybersecurity. Finally, we outlook the potential directions of this field for
future research."
"This chapter introduces the Accountability Principle and its role in data
protection governance. We focus on what accountability means in the context of
cybersecurity management in smart homes, considering the EU General Data
Protection Law requirements to secure personal data. This discussion sits
against the backdrop of two key new developments in data protection law.
Firstly, the law is moving into the home, due to narrowing of the so called
household exemption. Concurrently, household occupants may now have legal
responsibilities to comply with the GDPR, as they find themselves jointly
responsible for compliance, as they are possibly held to determine the means
and purposes of data collection with IoT device vendors. As a complex
socio-technical space, we consider the interactions between accountability
requirements and the competencies of this new class of domestic data
controllers (DDCs). Specifically, we consider the value and limitations of
edge-based security analytics to manage smart home cybersecurity risks,
reviewing a range of prototypes and studies of their use. We also reflect on
interpersonal power dynamics in the domestic setting e.g. device control;
existing social practices around privacy and security management in smart
homes; and usability issues that may hamper DDCs ability to rely on such
solutions. We conclude by reflecting on 1) the need for collective security
management in homes and 2) the increasingly complex divisions of responsibility
in smart homes between device users, account holders, IoT
device/software/firmware vendors, and third parties."
"Solving cybersecurity issues requires a holistic understanding of components,
factors, structures and their interactions in cyberspace, but conventional
modeling approaches view the field of cybersecurity by their boundaries so that
we are still not clear to cybersecurity and its changes. In this paper, we
attempt to discuss the application of systems thinking approaches to
cybersecurity modeling. This paper reviews the systems thinking approaches and
provides the systems theories and methods for tackling cybersecurity
challenges, regarding relevant fields, associated impact factors and their
interactions. Moreover, an illustrative example of systems thinking frameworks
for cybersecurity modeling is developed to help broaden the mind in
methodology, theory, technology and practice. This article concludes that
systems thinking can be considered as one of the powerful tools of
cybersecurity modeling to find, characterize, understand, evaluate and predict
cybersecurity."
"To be prepared against cyberattacks, most organizations resort to security
information and event management systems to monitor their infrastructures.
These systems depend on the timeliness and relevance of the latest updates,
patches and threats provided by cyberthreat intelligence feeds. Open source
intelligence platforms, namely social media networks such as Twitter, are
capable of aggregating a vast amount of cybersecurity-related sources. To
process such information streams, we require scalable and efficient tools
capable of identifying and summarizing relevant information for specified
assets. This paper presents the processing pipeline of a novel tool that uses
deep neural networks to process cybersecurity information received from
Twitter. A convolutional neural network identifies tweets containing
security-related information relevant to assets in an IT infrastructure. Then,
a bidirectional long short-term memory network extracts named entities from
these tweets to form a security alert or to fill an indicator of compromise.
The proposed pipeline achieves an average 94% true positive rate and 91% true
negative rate for the classification task and an average F1-score of 92% for
the named entity recognition task, across three case study infrastructures."
"In today's digital world, cybercrime is responsible for significant damage to
organizations, including financial losses, operational disruptions, or
intellectual property theft. Cyberattacks often start with an email, the major
means of corporate communication. Some rare, severely damaging email threats -
known as spear phishing or Business Email Compromise - have emerged. However,
the literature disagrees on their definition, impeding security vendors and
researchers from mitigating targeted attacks. Therefore, we introduce targeted
attacks. We describe targeted-attack-detection techniques as well as
social-engineering methods used by fraudsters. Additionally, we present
text-based attacks - with textual content as malicious payload - and compare
non-targeted and targeted variants."
"Cybersecurity in politics has emerged as a critical and intricate realm
intersecting technology, governance, and international relations. In this
interconnected digital context, political entities confront unparalleled
challenges in securing sensitive data, upholding democratic procedures, and
countering cyber threats. This study delves into the multifaceted landscape of
political cybersecurity, examining the evolving landscape of cyberattacks,
their impact on political stability, and strategies for bolstering digital
resilience. The intricate interplay between state-sponsored hacking,
disinformation campaigns, and eroding public trust underscores the imperative
for robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard political system integrity.
Through an extensive exploration of real-world case studies, policy frameworks,
and collaborative initiatives, this research illuminates the intricate network
of technological vulnerabilities, geopolitical dynamics, and ethical concerns
that shape the dynamic evolution of cybersecurity in politics. Amidst evolving
digital landscapes, the imperative for agile and preemptive cybersecurity
strategies is paramount for upholding the stability and credibility of
political institutions."
"Penetration testing, an essential component of cybersecurity, allows
organizations to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their
systems, thus bolstering their defense mechanisms against potential
cyberattacks. One recent advancement in the realm of penetration testing is the
utilization of Language Models (LLMs). We explore the intersection of LLMs and
penetration testing to gain insight into their capabilities and challenges in
the context of privilige escalation. We create an automated Linux
privilege-escalation benchmark utilizing local virtual machines. We introduce
an LLM-guided privilege-escalation tool designed for evaluating different LLMs
and prompt strategies against our benchmark. We analyze the impact of different
prompt designs, the benefits of in-context learning, and the advantages of
offering high-level guidance to LLMs. We discuss challenging areas for LLMs,
including maintaining focus during testing, coping with errors, and finally
comparing them with both stochastic parrots as well as with human hackers."
"Voice over IP (VoIP) is the transmission of voice and multimedia content over
Internet Protocol (IP) networks, this paper reviews models, frameworks and
auditing standards proposed to this date to manage VoIP security through a
literature review, with descriptions of both the historical and philosophical
evolution reflecting an adequate knowledge of related research. Three research
questions are raised here: RQ1. What are the requirements to be met by a model
of security audit in VoIP systems to achieve their goals? RQ2. Today, are there
additional attacks that previous works have not considered? RQ3. Which security
requirements in the VoIP systems are covered (and which are not covered) by
security frameworks? After some discussion about VoIP Protocols, Attacks on
VoIP, Information Technology (IT) audit, IT security audits, Frameworks and
auditing standards, we present a unified view of VoIP Security Requirements; as
well as considering the contributions and disadvantages of frameworks and
auditing standards toward achieving those requirements through a comparative
evaluation. It was determined that there is no security framework which
considers social engineering attacks in spite of being an important aspect to
consider in security management VoIP; also there is no specific framework that
covers all categories of security requirements for VoIP system, therefore, a
more extensive model is needed."
"Cybersecurity vulnerability information is often recorded by multiple
channels, including government vulnerability repositories,
individual-maintained vulnerability-gathering platforms, or
vulnerability-disclosure email lists and forums. Integrating vulnerability
information from different channels enables comprehensive threat assessment and
quick deployment to various security mechanisms. Efforts to automatically
gather such information, however, are impeded by the limitations of today's
entity alignment techniques. In our study, we annotate the first
cybersecurity-domain entity alignment dataset and reveal the unique
characteristics of security entities. Based on these observations, we propose
the first cybersecurity entity alignment model, CEAM, which equips GNN-based
entity alignment with two mechanisms: asymmetric masked aggregation and
partitioned attention. Experimental results on cybersecurity-domain entity
alignment datasets demonstrate that CEAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art entity alignment methods."
"Nowadays, botnets have become one of the major threats to cyber security. The
characteristics of botnets are mainly reflected in bots network behavior and
their intercommunication relationships. Existing botnet detection methods use
flow features or topology features individually, which overlook the other type
of feature. This affects model performance. In this paper, we propose a botnet
detection model which uses graph convolutional network (GCN) to deeply fuse
flow features and topology features for the first time. We construct
communication graphs from network traffic and represent nodes with flow
features. Due to the imbalance of existing public traffic flow datasets, it is
impossible to train a GCN model on these datasets. Therefore, we use a balanced
public communication graph dataset to pretrain a GCN model, thereby
guaranteeing its capacity for identify topology features. We then feed the
communication graph with flow features into the pretrained GCN. The output from
the last hidden layer is treated as the fusion of flow and topology features.
Additionally, by adjusting the number of layers in the GCN network, the model
can effectively detect botnets under both C2 and P2P structures. Validated on
the public ISCX2014 dataset, our approach achieves a remarkable recall rate
92.90% and F1-score 92.76% for C2 botnets, alongside recall rate 94.66% and
F1-score of 92.35% for P2P botnets. These results not only demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, but also outperform the performance of the
currently leading detection models."
"Vicious assaults, malware, and various ransomware pose a cybersecurity
threat, causing considerable damage to computer structures, servers, and mobile
and web apps across various industries and businesses. These safety concerns
are important and must be addressed immediately. Ransomware detection and
classification are critical for guaranteeing rapid reaction and prevention.
This study uses the XGBoost classifier and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to
detect and classify ransomware attacks. This approach involves analyzing the
behaviour of ransomware and extracting relevant features that can help
distinguish between different ransomware families. The models are evaluated on
a dataset of ransomware attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately detecting and classifying ransomware. The results show that the
XGBoost classifier, Random Forest Classifiers, can effectively detect and
classify different ransomware attacks with high accuracy, thereby providing a
valuable tool for enhancing cybersecurity."
"Recently, cybersecurity becomes more and more important due to the rapid
development of Internet. However, existing methods are in reality highly
sensitive to attacks and are far more vulnerable than expected, as they are
lack of trustable measures. In this paper, to address the aforementioned
problems, we propose a blockchain-based cybersecurity framework, termed as
Sapiens Chain, which can protect the privacy of the anonymous users and ensure
that the transactions are immutable by providing decentralized and trustable
services. Integrating semantic analysis, symbolic execution, and routing
learning methods into intelligent auditing, this framework can achieve good
accuracy for detecting hidden vulnerabilities. In addition, a revenue incentive
mechanism, which aims to donate participants, is built. The practical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
"There is no standard yet for measuring and controlling the costs associated
with implementing cybersecurity programs. To advance research and practice
towards this end, we develop a mapping using the well-known concept of quality
costs and the Framework Core within the Cybersecurity Framework produced by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in response to the
Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. This mapping can be easily adopted by
organizations that are already using the NIST CSF for cybersecurity risk
management to plan, manage, and continually improve cybersecurity operations.
If an organization is not using the NIST CSF, this mapping may still be useful
for linking elements in accounting systems that are associated with
cybersecurity operations and risk management to a quality cost model."
"Disk encryption today uses standard encryption methods that are length
preserving and do not require storing any additional information with an
encrypted disk sector. This significantly simplifies disk encryption management
as the disk mapping does not change with encryption. On the other hand, it
forces the encryption to be deterministic when data is being overwritten and it
disallows integrity mechanisms, thus lowering security guarantees. Moreover,
because the most widely used standard encryption methods (like AES-XTS) work at
small sub-blocks of no more than 32 bytes, deterministic overwrites form an
even greater security risk. Overall, today's standard practice forfeits some
security for ease of management and performance considerations. This
shortcoming is further amplified in a virtual disk setting that supports
versioning and snapshots so that overwritten data remains accessible.
  In this work, we address these concerns and stipulate that especially with
virtual disks, there is motivation and potential to improve security at the
expense of a small performance overhead. Specifically, adding per-sector
metadata to a virtual disk allows running encryption with a random
initialization vector (IV) as well as potentially adding integrity mechanisms.
We explore how best to implement additional per-sector information in Ceph RBD,
a popular open-source distributed block storage with client-side encryption. We
implement and evaluate several approaches and show that one can run AES-XTS
encryption with a random IV at a manageable overhead ranging from 1\%--22\%,
depending on the IO size."
"With the emergence of Artificial Intelligent chatbot tools such as ChatGPT
and code writing AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, educators need to question
what and how we should teach our courses and curricula in the future. In
reality, automated tools may result in certain academic fields being deeply
reduced in the number of employable people. In this work, we make a case study
of cybersecurity undergrad education by using the lens of ``Understanding by
Design'' (UbD). First, we provide a broad understanding of learning objectives
(LOs) in cybersecurity from a computer science perspective. Next, we dig a
little deeper into a curriculum with an undergraduate emphasis on cybersecurity
and examine the major courses and their LOs for our cybersecurity program at
Miami University. With these details, we perform a thought experiment on how
attainable the LOs are with the above-described tools, asking the key question
``what needs to be enduring concepts?'' learned in this process. If an LO
becomes something that the existence of automation tools might be able to do,
we then ask ``what level is attainable for the LO that is not a simple query to
the tools?''. With this exercise, we hope to establish an example of how to
prompt ChatGPT to accelerate students in their achievements of LOs given the
existence of these new AI tools, and our goal is to push all of us to leverage
and teach these tools as powerful allies in our quest to improve human
existence and knowledge."
"As cyber threats evolve and grow progressively more sophisticated, cyber
security is becoming a more significant concern in today's digital era.
Traditional security measures tend to be insufficient to defend against these
persistent and dynamic threats because they are mainly intuitional. One of the
most promising ways to handle this ongoing problem is utilizing the potential
of data-driven intelligence, by leveraging AI and machine learning techniques.
It can improve operational efficiency and saves response times by automating
repetitive operations, enabling real-time threat detection, and facilitating
incident response. In addition, it augments human expertise with insightful
information, predictive analytics, and enhanced decision-making, enabling them
to better understand and address evolving problems. Thus, data-driven
intelligence could significantly improve real-world cybersecurity solutions in
a wide range of application areas like critical infrastructure, smart cities,
digital twin, industrial control systems and so on. In this position paper, we
argue that data-driven intelligence can revolutionize the realm of
cybersecurity, offering not only large-scale task automation but also assist
human experts for better situation awareness and decision-making in real-world
scenarios."
"As the number of cyber-attacks is increasing, cybersecurity is evolving to a
key concern for any business. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) (in particular Deep Learning - DL) can be leveraged as key enabling
technologies for cyber-defense, since they can contribute in threat detection
and can even provide recommended actions to cyber analysts. A partnership of
industry, academia, and government on a global scale is necessary in order to
advance the adoption of AI/ML to cybersecurity and create efficient cyber
defense systems. In this paper, we are concerned with the investigation of the
various deep learning techniques employed for network intrusion detection and
we introduce a DL framework for cybersecurity applications."
"Cyber-security is an important societal concern. Cyber-attacks have increased
in numbers as well as in the extent of damage caused in every attack. Large
organizations operate a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC), which form the
first line of cyber-defense. The inspection of cyber-alerts is a critical part
of CSOC operations. A recent work, in collaboration with Army Research Lab, USA
proposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to prevent the
cyber-alert queue length from growing large and overwhelming the defender.
Given the potential deployment of this approach to CSOCs run by US defense
agencies, we perform a red team (adversarial) evaluation of this approach.
Further, with the recent attacks on learning systems, it is even more important
to test the limits of this RL approach. Towards that end, we learn an
adversarial alert generation policy that is a best response to the defender
inspection policy. Surprisingly, we find the defender policy to be quite robust
to the best response of the attacker. In order to explain this observation, we
extend the earlier RL model to a game model and show that there exists defender
policies that can be robust against any adversarial policy. We also derive a
competitive baseline from the game theory model and compare it to the RL
approach. However, we go further to exploit assumptions made in the MDP in the
RL model and discover an attacker policy that overwhelms the defender. We use a
double oracle approach to retrain the defender with episodes from this
discovered attacker policy. This made the defender robust to the discovered
attacker policy and no further harmful attacker policies were discovered.
Overall, the adversarial RL and double oracle approach in RL are general
techniques that are applicable to other RL usage in adversarial environments."
"Recent literature highlights a significant cross-impact between transfer
learning and cybersecurity. Many studies have been conducted on using transfer
learning to enhance security, leading to various applications in different
cybersecurity tasks. However, previous research is focused on specific areas of
cybersecurity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of transfer learning
applications in cybersecurity by covering a wide range of domains, identifying
current trends, and shedding light on under-explored areas. The survey
highlights the significance of transfer learning in addressing critical issues
in cybersecurity, such as improving detection accuracy, reducing training time,
handling data imbalance, and enhancing privacy preservation. Additional
insights are provided on the common problems solved using transfer learning,
such as the lack of labeled data, different data distributions, and privacy
concerns. The paper identifies future research directions and challenges that
require community attention, including the need for privacy-preserving models,
automatic tools for knowledge transfer, metrics for measuring domain
relatedness, and enhanced privacy preservation mechanisms. The insights and
roadmap presented in this paper will guide researchers in further advancing
transfer learning in cybersecurity, fostering the development of robust and
efficient cybersecurity systems to counter emerging threats and protect
sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of
its kind to present a comprehensive taxonomy of all areas of cybersecurity that
benefited from transfer learning and propose a detailed future roadmap to shape
the possible research direction in this area."
"Phishing emails are the first step for many of today's attacks. They come
with a simple hyperlink, request for action or a full replica of an existing
service or website. The goal is generally to trick the user to voluntarily give
away his sensitive information such as login credentials. Many approaches and
applications have been proposed and developed to catch and filter phishing
emails. However, the problem still lacks a complete and comprehensive solution.
In this paper, we apply knowledge discovery principles from data cleansing,
integration, selection, aggregation, data mining to knowledge extraction. We
study the feature effectiveness based on Information Gain and contribute two
new features to the literature. We compare six machine-learning approaches to
detect phishing based on a small number of carefully chosen features. We
calculate false positives, false negatives, mean absolute error, recall,
precision and F-measure and achieve very low false positive and negative rates.
Na{\""\i}ve Bayes has the least true positives rate and overall Neural Networks
holds the most promise for accurate phishing detection with accuracy of 99.4\%."
"Cybercrimes are on the rise, in part due to technological advancements, as
well as increased avenues of exploitation. Sophisticated threat actors are
leveraging on such advancements to execute their malicious intentions. The
increase in cybercrimes is prevalent, and it seems unlikely that they can be
easily eradicated. A more serious concern is that the community may come to
accept the notion that this will become the trend. As such, the key question
revolves around how we can reduce cybercrime in this evolving landscape. In our
paper, we propose to build a systematic framework through the lens of a cyber
threat actor. We explore the motivation factors behind the crimes and the crime
stages of the threat actors. We then formulate intervention plans so as to
discourage the act of committing malicious cyber activities and also aim to
integrate ex-cyber offenders back into society."
"The present study explored managerial and instructor perceptions of their
freshly employed cybersecurity workers' or students' preparedness to work
effectively in a changing cybersecurity environment that includes AI tools.
Specifically, we related perceptions of technical preparedness to ethical,
systems thinking, and communication skills. We found that managers and
professors perceive preparedness to use AI tools in cybersecurity to be
significantly associated with all three non-technical skill sets. Most
important, ethics is a clear leader in the network of relationships. Contrary
to expectations that ethical concerns are left behind in the rush to adopt the
most advanced AI tools in security, both higher education instructors and
managers appreciate their role and see them closely associated with technical
prowess. Another significant finding is that professors over-estimate students'
preparedness for ethical, system thinking, and communication abilities compared
to IT managers' perceptions of their newly employed IT workers."
"The present paper deals with the elucidation and implementation of the Data
Protection by Design (DPbD) principle as recently introduced in the European
Union data protection law, specifically with regards to cybersecurity systems
in a Smart Home environment, both from a legal and a technical perspective.
Starting point constitutes the research conducted in the Cyber-Trust project,
which endeavours the development of an innovative and customisable
cybersecurity platform for cyber-threat intelligence gathering, detection and
mitigation within the Internet of Things ecosystem. During the course of the
paper, the requirements of DPbD with regards to the conceptualisation, design
and actual development of the system are presented as prescribed in law. These
requirements are then translated into technical solutions, as envisaged in the
Cyber-Trust system. For trade-offs are not foreign to the DPbD context,
technical limitations and legal challenges are also discussed in this
interdisciplinary dialogue."
"The evolution of cybersecurity has spurred the emergence of autonomous threat
hunting as a pivotal paradigm in the realm of AI-driven threat intelligence.
This review navigates through the intricate landscape of autonomous threat
hunting, exploring its significance and pivotal role in fortifying cyber
defense mechanisms. Delving into the amalgamation of artificial intelligence
(AI) and traditional threat intelligence methodologies, this paper delineates
the necessity and evolution of autonomous approaches in combating contemporary
cyber threats. Through a comprehensive exploration of foundational AI-driven
threat intelligence, the review accentuates the transformative influence of AI
and machine learning on conventional threat intelligence practices. It
elucidates the conceptual framework underpinning autonomous threat hunting,
spotlighting its components, and the seamless integration of AI algorithms
within threat hunting processes.. Insightful discussions on challenges
encompassing scalability, interpretability, and ethical considerations in
AI-driven models enrich the discourse. Moreover, through illuminating case
studies and evaluations, this paper showcases real-world implementations,
underscoring success stories and lessons learned by organizations adopting
AI-driven threat intelligence. In conclusion, this review consolidates key
insights, emphasizing the substantial implications of autonomous threat hunting
for the future of cybersecurity. It underscores the significance of continual
research and collaborative efforts in harnessing the potential of AI-driven
approaches to fortify cyber defenses against evolving threats."
"This paper presents a comparative analysis between the Genetic Algorithm (GA)
and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), two vital artificial intelligence
algorithms, focusing on optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
parameters. These encompass the elliptic curve coefficients, prime number,
generator point, group order, and cofactor. The study provides insights into
which of the bio-inspired algorithms yields better optimization results for ECC
configurations, examining performances under the same fitness function. This
function incorporates methods to ensure robust ECC parameters, including
assessing for singular or anomalous curves and applying Pollard's rho attack
and Hasse's theorem for optimization precision. The optimized parameters
generated by GA and PSO are tested in a simulated e-commerce environment,
contrasting with well-known curves like secp256k1 during the transmission of
order messages using Elliptic Curve-Diffie Hellman (ECDH) and Hash-based
Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Focusing on traditional computing in the
pre-quantum era, this research highlights the efficacy of GA and PSO in ECC
optimization, with implications for enhancing cybersecurity in third-party
e-commerce integrations. We recommend the immediate consideration of these
findings before quantum computing's widespread adoption."
"Botnets are now a major source for many network attacks, such as DDoS attacks
and spam. However, most traditional detection methods heavily rely on
heuristically designed multi-stage detection criteria. In this paper, we
consider the neural network design challenges of using modern deep learning
techniques to learn policies for botnet detection automatically. To generate
training data, we synthesize botnet connections with different underlying
communication patterns overlaid on large-scale real networks as datasets. To
capture the important hierarchical structure of centralized botnets and the
fast-mixing structure for decentralized botnets, we tailor graph neural
networks (GNN) to detect the properties of these structures. Experimental
results show that GNNs are better able to capture botnet structure than
previous non-learning methods when trained with appropriate data, and that
deeper GNNs are crucial for learning difficult botnet topologies. We believe
our data and studies can be useful for both the network security and graph
learning communities."
"Context: Cybersecurity vendors often publish cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
reports, referring to the written artifacts on technical and forensic analysis
of the techniques used by the malware in APT attacks. Objective: The goal of
this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries
form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in
cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques
cataloged in MITRE ATT\&CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI
reports that MITRE ATT\&CK used as citations in the descriptions of the
cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and
trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the
implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to
identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform
qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques
in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370
techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for
37.3\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant
recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these
pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used
by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or
affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c)
overlapping in their implementations. Overall, the study quantifies how
adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on
publicly reported documents. We advocate organizations prioritize their defense
against the identified prevalent techniques and actively hunt for potential
malicious intrusion based on the identified pairs of techniques."
"Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is popularly used in practice for
privacy-preserving data collection. Although existing LDP protocols offer high
utility for large user populations (100,000 or more users), they perform poorly
in scenarios with small user populations (such as those in the cybersecurity
domain) and lack perturbation mechanisms that are effective for both ordinal
and non-ordinal item sequences while protecting sequence length and content
simultaneously. In this paper, we address the small user population problem by
introducing the concept of Condensed Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) as a
specialization of LDP, and develop a suite of CLDP protocols that offer
desirable statistical utility while preserving privacy. Our protocols support
different types of client data, ranging from ordinal data types in finite
metric spaces (numeric malware infection statistics), to non-ordinal items (OS
versions, transaction categories), and to sequences of ordinal and non-ordinal
items. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, including
datasets that are an order of magnitude smaller than those used in existing
approaches, which show that proposed CLDP protocols yield high utility.
Furthermore, case studies with Symantec datasets demonstrate that our protocols
accurately support key cybersecurity-focused tasks of detecting ransomware
outbreaks, identifying targeted and vulnerable OSs, and inspecting suspicious
activities on infected machines."
"Phishing is an especially challenging cyber security threat as it does not
attack computer systems, but targets the user who works on that system by
relying on the vulnerability of their decision-making ability. Phishing attacks
can be used to gather sensitive information from victims and can have
devastating impact if they are successful in deceiving the user. Several
anti-phishing tools have been designed and implemented but they have been
unable to solve the problem adequately. This failure is often due to security
experts overlooking the human element and ignoring their fallibility in making
trust decisions online. In this paper, we present Phish Phinder, a serious game
designed to enhance the user's confidence in mitigating phishing attacks by
providing them with both conceptual and procedural knowledge about phishing.
The user is trained through a series of gamified challenges, designed to
educate them about important phishing related concepts, through an interactive
user interface. Key elements of the game interface were identified through an
empirical study with the aim of enhancing user interaction with the game. We
also adopted several persuasive design principles while designing Phish Phinder
to enhance phishing avoidance behaviour among users."
"Supply chains are increasingly targeted by threat actors. Using a recent
taxonomy, we contrast the diverse levels of detail given by national
authorities. The threat is commonly acknowledged, but guidance is disjointed.
NIST SP 800-161 aligns closely with the taxonomy and offers a potential pathway
towards a common set of principles."
"Vessels cybersecurity is recently gaining momentum, as a result of a few
recent attacks to vessels at sea. These recent attacks have shacked the
maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats.
The cited belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the
International Maritime Organization (IMO). According to these regulations, all
vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical
controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is
laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats
affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the
potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of ""when"",
not ""if"". In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major
security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in
modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of
the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying
how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant
financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced
attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by
industry and academia to strengthen vessels security."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are considered an essential part of the EU
economy, however, highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. SMEs have specific
characteristics which separate them from large companies and influence their
adoption of good cybersecurity practices. To mitigate the SMEs' cybersecurity
adoption issues and raise their awareness of cyber threats, we have designed a
self-paced security assessment and capability improvement method, CYSEC. CYSEC
is a security awareness and training method that utilises self-reporting
questionnaires to collect companies' information about cybersecurity awareness,
practices, and vulnerabilities to generate automated recommendations for
counselling. However, confidentiality concerns about cybersecurity information
have an impact on companies' willingness to share their information. Security
information sharing decreases the risk of incidents and increases users'
self-efficacy in security awareness programs. This paper presents the results
of semi-structured interviews with seven chief information security officers of
SMEs to evaluate the impact of online consent communication on motivation for
information sharing. The results were analysed in respect of the Self
Determination Theory. The findings demonstrate that online consent with
multiple options for indicating a suitable level of agreement improved
motivation for information sharing. This allows many SMEs to participate in
security information sharing activities and supports security experts to have a
better overview of common vulnerabilities. The final publication is available
at Springer via https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57404-8_22"
"Quantum computing becomes more of a reality as time passes, bringing several
cybersecurity challenges. Modern cryptography is based on the computational
complexity of specific mathematical problems, but as new quantum-based
computers appear, classical methods might not be enough to secure
communications. In this paper, we analyse the state of the Galileo Open Service
Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) to overcome these new threats. This
analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation,
reviewing the available Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization
process, and studying the possibility of its implementation in the Galileo
service. The main barrier to adopting the PQC approach is the size of both the
signature and the key. The analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet prepared to
face the quantum threat, and a significant change would be required. This work
concludes by assessing different temporal countermeasures that can be
implemented to sustain the system's integrity in the short term."
"This Work-In-Progress Paper for the Innovative Practice Category presents a
novel experiment in active learning of cybersecurity. We introduced a new
workshop on hacking for an existing science-popularizing program at our
university. The workshop participants, 28 teenagers, played a cybersecurity
game designed for training undergraduates and professionals in penetration
testing. Unlike in learning environments that are simplified for young
learners, the game features a realistic virtual network infrastructure. This
allows exploring security tools in an authentic scenario, which is complemented
by a background story. Our research aim is to examine how young players
approach using cybersecurity tools by interacting with the professional game. A
preliminary analysis of the game session showed several challenges that the
workshop participants faced. Nevertheless, they reported learning about
security tools and exploits, and 61% of them reported wanting to learn more
about cybersecurity after the workshop. Our results support the notion that
young learners should be allowed more hands-on experience with security topics,
both in formal education and informal extracurricular events."
"The explosion in the e-commerce industry which has been necessitated by the
growth and advance expansion of Information technology and its related
facilities in recent years have been met with adverse security issues
consequently affecting the industry and the entire online activities. This
paper exams the prevailing security threats e-commerce is facing which is
predominantly known as cyber-crime and how computer related technology and
facilities such as digital forensics tools can be adopted extensively to ensure
security in online related business activities. This paper investigated the
risk, damage and the cost cyber-crime poses to individuals and organizations
when they become victims. As it is obvious transacting business online as well
as all related online activities has become inherent in our everyday life. The
paper also comprehensively elucidate on some of the cyber-crime activities that
are posing serious threat to the security of E-commerce. Amazon and eBay were
used as the case of study in relation to respondents who patronizes these
renowned e-commerce sites for various transactions.

"Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that aims at training
an algorithm across decentralized entities holding their local data private.
Wireless mobile networks allow users to communicate with other fixed or mobile
users. The road traffic network represents an infrastructure-based
configuration of a wireless mobile network where the Connected and Automated
Vehicles (CAV) represent the communicating entities. Applying FL in a wireless
mobile network setting gives rise to a new threat in the mobile environment
that is very different from the traditional fixed networks. The threat is due
to the intrinsic characteristics of the wireless medium and is caused by the
characteristics of the vehicular networks such as high node-mobility and
rapidly changing topology. Most cyber defense techniques depend on highly
reliable and connected networks. This paper explores falsified information
attacks, which target the FL process that is ongoing at the RSU. We identified
a number of attack strategies conducted by the malicious CAVs to disrupt the
training of the global model in vehicular networks. We show that the attacks
were able to increase the convergence time and decrease the accuracy the model.
We demonstrate that our attacks bypass FL defense strategies in their primary
form and highlight the need for novel poisoning resilience defense mechanisms
in the wireless mobile setting of the future road networks."
"Security risk assessment methods have served us well over the last two
decades. As the complexity, pervasiveness and automation of technology systems
increases, particularly with the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a
convincing argument that we will need new approaches to assess risk and build
system trust. In this article, we report on a series of scoping workshops and
interviews with industry professionals (experts in enterprise systems, IoT and
risk) conducted to investigate the validity of this argument. Additionally, our
research aims to consult with these professionals to understand two crucial
aspects. Firstly, we seek to identify the wider concerns in adopting IoT
systems into a corporate environment, be it a smart manufacturing shop floor or
a smart office. Secondly, we investigate the key challenges for approaches in
industry that attempt to effectively and efficiently assess cyber-risk in the
IoT."
"As the number of heterogenous IP-connected devices and traffic volume
increase, so does the potential for security breaches. The undetected
exploitation of these breaches can bring severe cybersecurity and privacy
risks. Anomaly-based \acp{IDS} play an essential role in network security. In
this paper, we present a practical unsupervised anomaly-based deep learning
detection system called ARCADE (Adversarially Regularized Convolutional
Autoencoder for unsupervised network anomaly DEtection). With a convolutional
\ac{AE}, ARCADE automatically builds a profile of the normal traffic using a
subset of raw bytes of a few initial packets of network flows so that potential
network anomalies and intrusions can be efficiently detected before they cause
more damage to the network. ARCADE is trained exclusively on normal traffic. An
adversarial training strategy is proposed to regularize and decrease the
\ac{AE}'s capabilities to reconstruct network flows that are out-of-the-normal
distribution, thereby improving its anomaly detection capabilities. The
proposed approach is more effective than state-of-the-art deep learning
approaches for network anomaly detection. Even when examining only two initial
packets of a network flow, ARCADE can effectively detect malware infection and
network attacks. ARCADE presents 20 times fewer parameters than baselines,
achieving significantly faster detection speed and reaction time."
"Active Malware Analysis involves modeling malware behavior by executing
actions to trigger responses and explore multiple execution paths. One of the
aims is making the action selection more efficient. This paper treats Active
Malware Analysis as a Bayes-Active Markov Decision Process and uses a Bayesian
Model Combination approach to train an analyzer agent. We show an improvement
in performance against other Bayesian and stochastic approaches to Active
Malware Analysis."
"Due to its simple installation and connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT)
is susceptible to malware attacks. Being able to operate autonomously. As IoT
devices have become more prevalent, they have become the most tempting targets
for malware. Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords, and a lack of security
measures contribute to these vulnerabilities along with insecure network
connections and outdated update procedures. To understand IoT malware, current
methods and analysis ,using static methods, are ineffective. The field of deep
learning has made great strides in recent years due to their tremendous data
mining, learning, and expression capabilities, cybersecurity has enjoyed
tremendous growth in recent years. As a result, malware analysts will not have
to spend as much time analyzing malware. In this paper, we propose a novel
detection and analysis method that harnesses the power and simplicity of
decision trees. The experiments are conducted using a real word dataset,
MaleVis which is a publicly available dataset. Based on the results, we show
that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in
that it achieves 97.23% precision and 95.89% recall in terms of detection and
classification. A specificity of 96.58%, F1-score of 96.40%, an accuracy of
96.43."
"The rapid digitalisation of SMEs, further expedited as a business continuity
measure against Covid19 impact, has brought along major cybersecurity
challenges, as it creates a fertile landscape for malicious actors, that want
to capitalise on the insufficient cybersecurity planning and preparedness of
SMEs to conduct low-effort, lucrative attacks. This paper constitutes a case
study on the cybersecurity challenges, specificities and the safeguarding of
the ATracker, a real-life data collection and analytics engine developed by the
SME Suite5. The ATracker has been successfully protected against attacks in
conjunction with the PUZZLE Framework, a holistic policy-based cybersecurity
solution, addressing major cybersecurity pillars and leveraging on the latest
scientific advancements in cybersecurity research."
"Spear phishing is a deceptive attack that uses social engineering to obtain
confidential information through targeted victimization. It is distinguished by
its use of social cues and personalized information to target specific victims.
Previous work on resilience to spear phishing has focused on convenience
samples, with a disproportionate focus on students. In contrast, here, we
report on an evaluation of a high school community. We engaged 57 high school
students and faculty members (12 high school students, 45 staff members) as
participants in research utilizing signal detection theory (SDT). Through
scenario-based analysis, participants tasked with distinguishing phishing
emails from authentic emails. The results revealed an overconfidence bias in
self-detection from the participants, regardless of their technical background.
These findings are critical for evaluating the decision-making of
underrepresented populations and protecting people from potential spear
phishing attacks by examining human susceptibility."
"The rise of cyber threats on critical infrastructure and its potential for
devastating consequences, has significantly increased. The dependency of new
power grid technology on information, data analytic and communication systems
make the entire electricity network vulnerable to cyber threats. Power
transformers play a critical role within the power grid and are now commonly
enhanced through factory add-ons or intelligent monitoring systems added later
to improve the condition monitoring of critical and long lead time assets such
as transformers. However, the increased connectivity of those power
transformers opens the door to more cyber attacks. Therefore, the need to
detect and prevent cyber threats is becoming critical. The first step towards
that would be a deeper understanding of the potential cyber-attacks landscape
against power transformers. Much of the existing literature pays attention to
smart equipment within electricity distribution networks, and most methods
proposed are based on model-based detection algorithms. Moreover, only a few of
these works address the security vulnerabilities of power elements, especially
transformers within the transmission network. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no study in the literature that systematically investigate the
cybersecurity challenges against the newly emerged smart transformers. This
paper addresses this shortcoming by exploring the vulnerabilities and the
attack vectors of power transformers within electricity networks, the possible
attack scenarios and the risks associated with these attacks."
"Electric Vehicles (EVs) share common technologies with classical
fossil-fueled cars, but they also employ novel technologies and components
(e.g., Charging System and Battery Management System) that create an unexplored
attack surface for malicious users. Although multiple contributions in the
literature explored cybersecurity aspects of particular components of the EV
ecosystem (e.g., charging infrastructure), there is still no contribution to
the holistic cybersecurity of EVs and their related technologies from a
cyber-physical system perspective.
  In this paper, we provide the first in-depth study of the security and
privacy threats associated with the EVs ecosystem. We analyze the threats
associated with both the EV and the different charging solutions. Focusing on
the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) paradigm, we provide a detailed analysis of
all the processes that an attacker might exploit to affect the security and
privacy of both drivers and the infrastructure. To address the highlighted
threats, we present possible solutions that might be implemented. We also
provide an overview of possible future directions to guarantee the security and
privacy of the EVs ecosystem. Based on our analysis, we stress the need for
EV-specific cybersecurity solutions."
"The NIS Directive introduces obligations for the security of the network and
information systems of operators of essential services and of digital service
providers and require from the national competent authorities to assess their
compliance to these obligations. This paper describes a novel cybersecurity
maturity assessment framework (CMAF) that is tailored to the NIS Directive
requirements and can be used either as a self assessment tool from critical
national infrastructures either as an audit tool from the National Competent
Authorities for cybersecurity."
"In this era of explosive growth in technology, the internet of things (IoT)
has become the game changer when we consider technologies like smart homes and
cities, smart energy, security and surveillance, and healthcare. The numerous
benefits provided by IoT have become attractive technologies for users and
cybercriminals. Cybercriminals of today have the tools and the technology to
deploy millions of sophisticated attacks. These attacks need to be
investigated; this is where digital forensics comes into play. However, it is
not easy to conduct a forensic investigation in IoT systems because of the
heterogeneous nature of the IoT environment. Additionally, forensic
investigators mostly rely on evidence from service providers, a situation that
can lead to evidence contamination. To solve this problem, the authors proposed
a blockchain-based IoT forensic model that prevents the admissibility of
tampered logs into evidence."
"Cyber assurance, which is the ability to operate under the onslaught of cyber
attacks and other unexpected events, is essential for organizations facing
inundating security threats on a daily basis. Organizations usually employ
multiple strategies to conduct risk management to achieve cyber assurance.
Utilizing cybersecurity standards and certifications can provide guidance for
vendors to design and manufacture secure Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) products as well as provide a level of assurance of the
security functionality of the products for consumers. Hence, employing security
standards and certifications is an effective strategy for risk management and
cyber assurance. In this work, we begin with investigating the adoption of
cybersecurity standards and certifications by surveying 258 participants from
organizations across various countries and sectors. Specifically, we identify
adoption barriers of the Common Criteria through the designed questionnaire.
Taking into account the seven identified adoption barriers, we show the
recommendations for promoting cybersecurity standards and certifications.
Moreover, beyond cybersecurity standards and certifications, we shed light on
other risk management strategies devised by our participants, which provides
directions on cybersecurity approaches for enhancing cyber assurance in
organizations."
"In IoT, smart sensors enable data collection, real-time monitoring,
decision-making, and automation, but their proliferation exposes them to
cybersecurity threats. Zero Trust Architecture enhances IoT security by
challenging conventional trust models and emphasizing continuous trust
verification in the overall \$875.0 billion IoT market projected by 2025. This
paper presents a new zero-trust real-time lightweight access control protocol
for Cloud-centric dynamic IoT sensor networks. This protocol empowers data
owners, referred to as sensor coordinators, to define intricate access
policies, blending recipient identifiers and data-related attributes for data
encryption. Additionally, the protocol incorporates efficient cryptographic
primitives, eliminating the need for reliance on a trusted party. Furthermore,
it ensures real-time data access while preserving data confidentiality and user
privacy through seamless data upload to the cloud and the offloading of
computationally intensive tasks from resource-constrained data owners and
sensors. The protocol utilizes Merkle Trees for lightweight, ongoing trust
measurement of sensors, ensuring efficient trust assessment by sensor
coordinators. Simultaneously, the cloud conducts thorough trust evaluations for
network entities including users. Comprehensive security analysis and
performance evaluation highlight the protocol's effectiveness in tackling the
multifaceted security challenges of IoT ecosystems while ensuring scalability
and high availability."
"In this research paper, our intent is to outline different types of malware,
their means of operation, and how they are detected in order to protect
yourself against such attacks. Varied permission, and limited technical
resources mean that detecting malware and such attacks becomes more difficult.
With the normal user being limited to the UI, their ability to see what happens
in the background is virtually limited to none. Many do not have control on how
they distribute permission over the data the applications they use controls, or
how that data is stored or distributed. They also do not receive any
notification as to whether their data is protected against various attacks and
if it has not been attacked already. In this paper, we present evidence on what
malware is, how malware operates, different types of malware, and the general
means of defence."
"The cyber terrain contains devices, network services, cyber personas, and
other network entities involved in network operations. Designing a method that
automatically identifies key network entities to network operations is
challenging. However, such a method is essential for determining which cyber
assets should the cyber defense focus on. In this paper, we propose an approach
for the classification of IP addresses belonging to cyber key terrain according
to their network position using the PageRank centrality computation adjusted by
machine learning. We used hill climbing and random walk algorithms to
distinguish PageRank's damping factors based on source and destination ports
captured in IP flows. The one-time learning phase on a static data sample
allows near-real-time stream-based classification of key hosts from IP flow
data in operational conditions without maintaining a complete network graph. We
evaluated the approach on a dataset from a cyber defense exercise and on data
from the campus network. The results show that cyber key terrain identification
using the adjusted computation of centrality is more precise than its original
version."
"Extracting cybersecurity entities such as attackers and vulnerabilities from
unstructured network texts is an important part of security analysis. However,
the sparsity of intelligence data resulted from the higher frequency variations
and the randomness of cybersecurity entity names makes it difficult for current
methods to perform well in extracting security-related concepts and entities.
To this end, we propose a semantic augmentation method which incorporates
different linguistic features to enrich the representation of input tokens to
detect and classify the cybersecurity names over unstructured text. In
particular, we encode and aggregate the constituent feature, morphological
feature and part of speech feature for each input token to improve the
robustness of the method. More than that, a token gets augmented semantic
information from its most similar K words in cybersecurity domain corpus where
an attentive module is leveraged to weigh differences of the words, and from
contextual clues based on a large-scale general field corpus. We have conducted
experiments on the cybersecurity datasets DNRTI and MalwareTextDB, and the
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"Spear phishing is a widespread concern in the modern network security
landscape, but there are few metrics that measure the extent to which
reconnaissance is performed on phishing targets. Spear phishing emails closely
match the expectations of the recipient, based on details of their experiences
and interests, making them a popular propagation vector for harmful malware. In
this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to investigate a
specific real-world phishing campaign and quantify attributes that indicate a
targeted spear phishing attack. Our phishing campaign data sample comprises 596
emails - all containing a web bug and a Curriculum Vitae (CV) PDF attachment -
sent to our institution by a foreign IP space. The campaign was found to
exclusively target specific demographics within our institution. Performing a
semantic similarity analysis between the senders' CV attachments and the
recipients' LinkedIn profiles, we conclude with high statistical certainty (p
$< 10^{-4}$) that the attachments contain targeted rather than randomly
selected material. Latent Semantic Analysis further demonstrates that
individuals who were a primary focus of the campaign received CVs that are
highly topically clustered. These findings differentiate this campaign from one
that leverages random spam."
"Security is a major concern for organizations who wish to leverage cloud
computing. In order to reduce security vulnerabilities, public cloud providers
offer firewall functionalities. When properly configured, a firewall protects
cloud networks from cyber-attacks. However, proper firewall configuration
requires intimate knowledge of the protected system, high expertise and
on-going maintenance.
  As a result, many organizations do not use firewalls effectively, leaving
their cloud resources vulnerable. In this paper, we present a novel supervised
learning method, and prototype, which compute recommendations for firewall
rules. Recommendations are based on sampled network traffic meta-data (NetFlow)
collected from a public cloud provider. Labels are extracted from firewall
configurations deemed to be authored by experts. NetFlow is collected from
network routers, avoiding expensive collection from cloud VMs, as well as
relieving privacy concerns.
  The proposed method captures network routines and dependencies between
resources and firewall configuration. The method predicts IPs to be allowed by
the firewall. A grouping algorithm is subsequently used to generate a
manageable number of IP ranges. Each range is a parameter for a firewall rule.
  We present results of experiments on real data, showing ROC AUC of 0.92,
compared to 0.58 for an unsupervised baseline. The results prove the hypothesis
that firewall rules can be automatically generated based on router data, and
that an automated method can be effective in blocking a high percentage of
malicious traffic."
"The security of industrial network has become an increasing concern in
industry infrastructure operation. Motivated by on-going collaborations with
Fortinet Corp., a security company, this project implements a testbed for
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network security research by
software emulation. Concepts about SCADA and Modbus protocol are reviewed in
the report. Besides Modbus, vulnerabilities about several other industrial
protocols are also studied for this project. In this report, a typical tank
system following Modbus protocol is built as a testbed. Both attack and defense
toolkits are introduced to emulate the attack and protection of the Modbus
network. The emulation platform is also capable of entrapping hackers and
gathering their activity data."
"This study aims to develop a model for the user acceptance for implementing
the information security standard (i.e. ISO 27001) in Turkish public
organizations. The results of the surveys performed in Turkey reveal that the
legislation on information security public which organizations have to obey is
significantly related with the user acceptance during ISO 27001 implementation
process. The fundamental components of our user acceptance model are perceived
usefulness, attitude towards use, social norms, and performance expectancy."
"In the area of information technology, cybersecurity is critical. Information
security is one of todays highest priorities. Cyber attacks, which are on the
rise and include Ransomware, are the first thing that springs to mind when we
think about cybersecurity. To counteract cybercrime, several governments and
companies employ a range of strategies. Despite several cybersecurity measures,
ransomware continues to terrify people."
"Cyber threats, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), ransomware, and
zero-day exploits, are rapidly evolving and demand improved security measures.
Honeypots and honeynets, as deceptive systems, offer valuable insights into
attacker behavior, helping researchers and practitioners develop innovative
defense strategies and enhance detection mechanisms. However, their deployment
involves significant maintenance and overhead expenses. At the same time, the
complexity of modern computing has prompted the rise of autonomic computing,
aiming for systems that can operate without human intervention. Recent honeypot
and honeynet research claims to incorporate autonomic computing principles,
often using terms like adaptive, dynamic, intelligent, and learning. This study
investigates such claims by measuring the extent to which autonomic principles
principles are expressed in honeypot and honeynet literature. The findings
reveal that autonomic computing keywords are present in the literature sample,
suggesting an evolution from self-adaptation to autonomic computing
implementations. Yet, despite these findings, the analysis also shows low
frequencies of self-configuration, self-healing, and self-protection keywords.
Interestingly, self-optimization appeared prominently in the literature. While
this study presents a foundation for the convergence of autonomic computing and
deceptive systems, future research could explore technical implementations in
sample articles and test them for autonomic behavior. Additionally,
investigations into the design and implementation of individual autonomic
computing principles in honeypots and determining the necessary ratio of these
principles for a system to exhibit autonomic behavior could provide valuable
insights for both researchers and practitioners."
"Designing cyber defense systems to account for cognitive biases in human
decision making has demonstrated significant success in improving performance
against human attackers. However, much of the attention in this area has
focused on relatively simple accounts of biases in human attackers, and little
is known about adversarial behavior or how defenses could be improved by
disrupting attacker's behavior. In this work, we present a novel model of human
decision-making inspired by the cognitive faculties of Instance-Based Learning
Theory, Theory of Mind, and Transfer of Learning. This model functions by
learning from both roles in a security scenario: defender and attacker, and by
making predictions of the opponent's beliefs, intentions, and actions. The
proposed model can better defend against attacks from a wide range of opponents
compared to alternatives that attempt to perform optimally without accounting
for human biases. Additionally, the proposed model performs better against a
range of human-like behavior by explicitly modeling human transfer of learning,
which has not yet been applied to cyber defense scenarios. Results from
simulation experiments demonstrate the potential usefulness of cognitively
inspired models of agents trained in attack and defense roles and how these
insights could potentially be used in real-world cybersecurity."
"Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure have been an issue of importance in
industry over the past several years, as well as a focus of academic research.
Cyber attacks of various types and magnitude have been on the rise targeted
specifically at power grids. A successful attack on the power grid could result
in significant impacts including grid shutdown, cascading failures, damage to
the infrastructure, and potential harm to people. Power grid infrastructure are
critical in nature, they enable operations for residential, commercial,
industrial, and government users across critical infrastructure such as water,
communication, banking, transportation, manufacturing, and more. The compromise
of these operations introduces threats, which span from economic to public
safety. The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is now being rapidly
deployed throughout the power grid, and is an enabling technology for smart
grid. Identifying the attack surface is a necessary step in achieving cyber
security in smart grids and AMI. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and
examine the cyber attack surface of AMI in order to lay the foundation for
mitigating approaches to AMI cyber security."
"Industry 4.0 is a blend of the hyper-connected digital industry within two
world of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). With this
amalgamate opportunity, smart manufacturing involves production assets with the
manufacturing equipment having its own intelligence, while the system-wide
intelligence is provided by the cyber layer. However Smart manufacturing now
becomes one of the prime targets of cyber threats due to vulnerabilities in the
existing process of operation. Since smart manufacturing covers a vast area of
production industries from cyber physical system to additive manufacturing, to
autonomous vehicles, to cloud based IIoT (Industrial IoT), to robotic
production, cyber threat stands out with this regard questioning about how to
connect manufacturing resources by network, how to integrate a whole process
chain for a factory production etc. Cybersecurity confidentiality, integrity
and availability expose their essential existence for the proper operational
thread model known as digital thread ensuring secure manufacturing. In this
work, a literature survey is presented from the existing threat models, attack
vectors and future challenges over the digital thread of smart manufacturing."
"Awareness of cybersecurity topics facilitates software developers to produce
secure code. This awareness is especially important in industrial environments
for the products and services in critical infrastructures. In this work, we
address how to raise awareness of software developers on the topic of secure
coding. We propose the ""CyberSecurity Challenges"", a serious game designed to
be used in an industrial environment and address software developers' needs.
Our work distils the experience gained in conducting these CyberSecurity
Challenges in an industrial setting. The main contributions are the design of
the CyberSecurity Challenges events, the analysis of the perceived benefits,
and practical advice for practitioners who wish to design or refine these
games."
"Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular as a go-to approach for
many tasks due to its world-class results. As a result, antivirus developers
are incorporating machine learning models into their products. While these
models improve malware detection capabilities, they also carry the disadvantage
of being susceptible to adversarial attacks. Although this vulnerability has
been demonstrated for many models in white-box settings, a black-box attack is
more applicable in practice for the domain of malware detection. We present a
generator of adversarial malware examples using reinforcement learning
algorithms. The reinforcement learning agents utilize a set of
functionality-preserving modifications, thus creating valid adversarial
examples. Using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, we achieved
an evasion rate of 53.84% against the gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)
model. The PPO agent previously trained against the GBDT classifier scored an
evasion rate of 11.41% against the neural network-based classifier MalConv and
an average evasion rate of 2.31% against top antivirus programs. Furthermore,
we discovered that random application of our functionality-preserving portable
executable modifications successfully evades leading antivirus engines, with an
average evasion rate of 11.65%. These findings indicate that machine
learning-based models used in malware detection systems are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks and that better safeguards need to be taken to protect
these systems."
"Proactive cyber-risk assessment is gaining momentum due to the wide range of
sectors that can benefit from the prevention of cyber-incidents. The increasing
connectivity of digital and (cyber-)physical systems requires more attention to
cybersecurity to enhance the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of
data. We introduce a statistical framework for the prioritisation of
cyber-vulnerabilities, using robust and interpretable regression models to
support decision-making. Specifically, we take advantage of mid-quantile
regression to deal with ordinal risk assessments, and we compare it to current
alternatives for cyber-risk ranking and graded responses, identifying a novel
accuracy measure suited for rankings with partial knowledge of existing
vulnerabilities. Our model is tested on both simulated and real data from
selected databases that support the exploitation of cyber-vulnerabilities in
real contexts. The variety of information arising from such datasets allows us
to compare multiple models based on their predictive performance, showing how
accessible information can influence perception and, hence, decision-making in
operational scenarios. Applications to threat intelligence are discussed too."
"Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network
security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various
cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P
botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively.
We propose Enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior
analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P
network flow detection component. Then, it uses ""mutual contacts"" to cluster
bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior
analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we
propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our
techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots
mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that
Enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives,
and high robustness against the proposed attacks."
"The electronic mail plays an unavoidable role in the humankind
communications. With the great interest for the connection via mobile
platforms, and the growing number of vulnerabilities and attacks, it is
essential to provide suitable security solutions regarding the limitations of
resource restricted platforms. Although some solutions such as PGP and S/MIME
are currently available for the secure e-mail over the Internet, they are based
on traditional public key cryptography that involves huge computational costs.
In this paper, a new secure application-layer protocol, called SMEmail, is
introduced that provides several security attributes such as confidentiality,
integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and forward secrecy of message
confidentiality for the electronic mails. SMEmail offers an elliptic
curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secure key
establishment of a symmetric encryption, and is so suitable for the resource
restricted platforms such as mobile phones."
"Renewable energy sources (RES) are among the most popular emerging energy
resources during the past two decades. Many countries have introduced various
energy policy instruments, such as renewable energy certificates (RECs), to
support the growth of RES. RECs are tradable non-tangible assets, which have a
monetary value. Tracking and certification of the origin of an energy resource
regardless of its type (e.g., a conventional power plant or RES) is a critical
operation. In addition to the certification of origin, trading transactions are
needed to be performed using a secure method. Energy industry participants need
to secure the data and applications related to RECs. Distributed ledger
technology (DLT) is a perfect framework that can support such REC
functionalities. This paper addresses the cybersecurity aspects in REC trading
using Blockchain and a distributed ledger technology, considering detailed
cybersecurity perspectives."
"Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity,
with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular
communications. These functionalities require the integration of information
and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly
configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses
circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation
bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also
proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation
through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly
growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel
approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create
and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using
pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal
attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is
intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a
priori knowledge."
"Cybersecurity planning is challenging for digitized companies that want
adequate protection without overspending money. Currently, the lack of
investments and perverse economic incentives are the root cause of
cyberattacks, which results in several economic impacts on companies worldwide.
Therefore, cybersecurity planning has to consider technical and economic
dimensions to help companies achieve a better cybersecurity strategy. This
article introduces SECAdvisor, a tool to support cybersecurity planning using
economic models. SECAdvisor allows to (a) understand the risks and valuation of
different businesses' information, (b) calculate the optimal investment in
cybersecurity for a company, (c) receive a recommendation of protections based
on the budget available and demands, and (d) compare protection solutions in
terms of cost-efficiency. Furthermore, evaluations on usability and real-world
training activities performed using SECAdvisor are discussed."
"Through international regulations (most prominently the latest UNECE
regulation) and standards, the already widely perceived higher need for
cybersecurity in automotive systems has been recognized and will mandate higher
efforts for cybersecurity engineering. T he UNECE also demands the
effectiveness of these engineering to be verified and validated through
testing. T his requires both a significantly higher rate and more
comprehensiveness of cybersecurity testing that is not effectively to cope with
using current, predominantly manual, automotive cybersecurity testing
techniques. To allow for comprehensive and efficient testing at all stages of
the automotive life cycle, including supply chain parts not at band, and to
facilitate efficient third party testing, as well as to test under real-world
conditions, also methodologies for testing the cybersecurity of vehicular
systems as a black box are necessary. T his paper therefore presents a model
and attack tree-based approach to (semi-)automate automotive cybersecurity
testing, as well as considerations for automatically black box-deriving models
for the use in attack modeling."
"Cyber-defense systems are being developed to automatically ingest Cyber
Threat Intelligence (CTI) that contains semi-structured data and/or text to
populate knowledge graphs. A potential risk is that fake CTI can be generated
and spread through Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) communities or on the Web
to effect a data poisoning attack on these systems. Adversaries can use fake
CTI examples as training input to subvert cyber defense systems, forcing the
model to learn incorrect inputs to serve their malicious needs.
  In this paper, we automatically generate fake CTI text descriptions using
transformers. We show that given an initial prompt sentence, a public language
model like GPT-2 with fine-tuning, can generate plausible CTI text with the
ability of corrupting cyber-defense systems. We utilize the generated fake CTI
text to perform a data poisoning attack on a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph
(CKG) and a cybersecurity corpus. The poisoning attack introduced adverse
impacts such as returning incorrect reasoning outputs, representation
poisoning, and corruption of other dependent AI-based cyber defense systems. We
evaluate with traditional approaches and conduct a human evaluation study with
cybersecurity professionals and threat hunters. Based on the study,
professional threat hunters were equally likely to consider our fake generated
CTI as true."
"Similarity search is essential to many important applications and often
involves searching at scale on high-dimensional data based on their similarity
to a query. In biometric applications, recent vulnerability studies have shown
that adversarial machine learning can compromise biometric recognition systems
by exploiting the biometric similarity information. Existing methods for
biometric privacy protection are in general based on pairwise matching of
secured biometric templates and have inherent limitations in search efficiency
and scalability. In this paper, we propose an inference-based framework for
privacy-preserving similarity search in Hamming space. Our approach builds on
an obfuscated distance measure that can conceal Hamming distance in a dynamic
interval. Such a mechanism enables us to systematically design statistically
reliable methods for retrieving most likely candidates without knowing the
exact distance values. We further propose to apply Montgomery multiplication
for generating search indexes that can withstand adversarial similarity
analysis, and show that information leakage in randomized Montgomery domains
can be made negligibly small. Our experiments on public biometric datasets
demonstrate that the inference-based approach can achieve a search accuracy
close to the best performance possible with secure computation methods, but the
associated cost is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to cryptographic
primitives."
"Identity Prove Limited (IDPL) is a long-founded online identity verification
software provider of citizens for Banking services. IDPL applies an information
governance based on the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard of security and within GDPR
to accomplish face verification. The company has a good reputation for
biometric authentication services that allow a secure, simple, sustainable

optimum scale of system performance capabilities. The aim of information
governance policy is to declare and to demonstrate the performance of the
company on effectively and efficiently way in front of risk detection and
vulnerability mitigation. The scope of this policy involves all management

"Biometric authentication systems are presented as the best way to reach high
security levels in controlling access to IT systems or sensitive
infrastructures. But several issues are often not taken properly into account.
In order for the implementation of those systems to be successful, the hidden
risks and the related liabilities have to be carefully analyzed before
biometrics can be used on a large scale for sensitive applications."
"In this paper, we present an operational system for cyber threat intelligence
gathering from various social platforms on the Internet particularly sites on
the darknet and deepnet. We focus our attention to collecting information from
hacker forum discussions and marketplaces offering products and services
focusing on malicious hacking. We have developed an operational system for
obtaining information from these sites for the purposes of identifying emerging
cyber threats. Currently, this system collects on average 305 high-quality
cyber threat warnings each week. These threat warnings include information on
newly developed malware and exploits that have not yet been deployed in a
cyber-attack. This provides a significant service to cyber-defenders. The
system is significantly augmented through the use of various data mining and
machine learning techniques. With the use of machine learning models, we are
able to recall 92% of products in marketplaces and 80% of discussions on forums
relating to malicious hacking with high precision. We perform preliminary
analysis on the data collected, demonstrating its application to aid a security
expert for better threat analysis."
"As a national critical infrastructure, the smart grid has attracted
widespread attention for its cybersecurity issues. The development towards an
intelligent, digital, and Internetconnected smart grid has attracted external
adversaries for malicious activities. It is necessary to enhance its
cybersecurity by either improving the existing defense approaches or
introducing novel developed technologies to the smart grid context. As an
emerging technology, digital twin (DT) is considered as an enabler for enhanced
security. However, the practical implementation is quite challenging. This is
due to the knowledge barriers among smart grid designers, security experts, and
DT developers. Each single domain is a complicated system covering various
components and technologies. As a result, works are needed to sort out relevant
contents so that DT can be better embedded in the security architecture design
of smart grid. In order to meet this demand, our paper covers the above three
domains, i.e., smart grid, cybersecurity, and DT. Specifically, the paper i)
introduces the background of the smart grid; ii) reviews external cyber attacks
from attack incidents and attack methods; iii) introduces critical defense
approaches in industrial cyber systems, which include device identification,
vulnerability discovery, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), honeypots,
attribution, and threat intelligence (TI); iv) reviews the relevant content of
DT, including its basic concepts, applications in the smart grid, and how DT
enhances the security. In the end, the paper puts forward our security
considerations on the future development of DT-based smart grid. The survey is
expected to help developers break knowledge barriers among smart grid,
cybersecurity, and DT, and provide guidelines for future security design of
DT-based smart grid."
"Security provisioning has become the most important design consideration for
large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to their critical roles to
support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogenous devices,
machines and industry processes. Conventional authentication and authorization
schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to
their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity
for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for
different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead
to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and
overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled
security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast
authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a
lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring
machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or
frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic
authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and
trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and
achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish
the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security
progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks
are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline several areas for
AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches."
"Serious games are increasingly being used in cybersecurity education to
engage and educate users. Several studies with cybersecurity serious games have
shown that they are successful in educating users and the users also find them
both fun and engaging. Meanwhile, several studies have also reported issues in
identifying real life effects of the game and even the long-term effects that
they have. Based on our experience with enterprise cybersecurity games and
games from recent literature, we discuss a few key challenges that must be
considered while designing and evaluating serious games for cybersecurity
awareness."
"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a proven approach to secure networks.
However, in a privately used network, it is difficult for users without
cybersecurity expertise to understand IDS alerts, and to respond in time with
adequate measures. This puts the security of home networks, smart home
installations, home-office workers, etc. at risk, even if an IDS is correctly
installed and configured. In this work, we propose ChatIDS, our approach to
explain IDS alerts to non-experts by using large language models. We evaluate
the feasibility of ChatIDS by using ChatGPT, and we identify open research
issues with the help of interdisciplinary experts in artificial intelligence.
Our results show that ChatIDS has the potential to increase network security by
proposing meaningful security measures in an intuitive language from IDS
alerts. Nevertheless, some potential issues in areas such as trust, privacy,
ethics, etc. need to be resolved, before ChatIDS might be put into practice."
"The cyber risk insurance market is at a nascent stage of its development,
even as the magnitude of cyber losses is significant and the rate of cyber loss
events is increasing. Existing cyber risk insurance products as well as
academic studies have been focusing on classifying cyber loss events and
developing models of these events, but little attention has been paid to
proposing insurance risk transfer strategies that incentivise mitigation of
cyber loss through adjusting the premium of the risk transfer product. To
address this important gap, we develop a Bonus-Malus model for cyber risk
insurance. Specifically, we propose a mathematical model of cyber risk
insurance and cybersecurity provisioning supported with an efficient numerical
algorithm based on dynamic programming. Through a numerical experiment, we
demonstrate how a properly designed cyber risk insurance contract with a
Bonus-Malus system can resolve the issue of moral hazard and benefit the
insurer."
"Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are widely
deployed for defending various cyberattacks. Existing learning-based NIDS
mainly uses Neural Network (NN) as a classifier that relies on the quality and
quantity of cyberattack data. Such NN-based approaches are also hard to
interpret for improving efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we design a
new local-global computation paradigm, FEDFOREST, a novel learning-based NIDS
by combining the interpretable Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and
Federated Learning (FL) framework. Specifically, FEDFOREST is composed of
multiple clients that extract local cyberattack data features for the server to
train models and detect intrusions. A privacy-enhanced technology is also
proposed in FEDFOREST to further defeat the privacy of the FL systems.
Extensive experiments on 4 cyberattack datasets of different tasks demonstrate
that FEDFOREST is effective, efficient, interpretable, and extendable.
FEDFOREST ranks first in the collaborative learning and cybersecurity
competition 2021 for Chinese college students."
"Botnets have come a long way since their inception a few decades ago.
Originally toy programs written by network hobbyists, modern-day botnets can be
used by cyber criminals to steal billions of dollars from users, corporations,
and governments. This paper will look at cutting-edge botnet features and
detection strategies from over a dozen research papers, supplemented by a few
additional sources. With this data, I will then hypothesize what the future of
botnets might hold."
"Phishing is a well-known cybersecurity attack that has rapidly increased in
recent years. It poses legitimate risks to businesses, government agencies, and
all users due to sensitive data breaches, subsequent financial and productivity
losses, and social and personal inconvenience. Often, these attacks use social
engineering techniques to deceive end-users, indicating the importance of
user-focused studies to help prevent future attacks. We provide a detailed
overview of phishing research that has focused on users by conducting a
systematic literature review of peer-reviewed academic papers published in ACM
Digital Library. Although published work on phishing appears in this data set
as early as 2004, we found that of the total number of papers on phishing (N =
367) only 13.9% (n = 51) focus on users by employing user study methodologies
such as interviews, surveys, and in-lab studies. Even within this small subset
of papers, we note a striking lack of attention to reporting important
information about methods and participants (e.g., the number and nature of
participants), along with crucial recruitment biases in some of the research."
"The cybersecurity landscape evolves rapidly and poses threats to
organizations. To enhance resilience, one needs to track the latest
developments and trends in the domain. It has been demonstrated that standard
bibliometrics approaches show their limits in such a fast-evolving domain. For
this purpose, we use large language models (LLMs) to extract relevant knowledge
entities from cybersecurity-related texts. We use a subset of arXiv preprints
on cybersecurity as our data and compare different LLMs in terms of entity
recognition (ER) and relevance. The results suggest that LLMs do not produce
good knowledge entities that reflect the cybersecurity context, but our results
show some potential for noun extractors. For this reason, we developed a noun
extractor boosted with some statistical analysis to extract specific and
relevant compound nouns from the domain. Later, we tested our model to identify
trends in the LLM domain. We observe some limitations, but it offers promising
results to monitor the evolution of emergent trends."
"The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol plays a major role in today's Internet
as it translates between website names and corresponding IP addresses. However,
due to the lack of processes for data integrity and origin authentication, the
DNS protocol has several security vulnerabilities. This often leads to a
variety of cyber-attacks, including botnet network attacks. One promising
solution to detect DNS-based botnet attacks is adopting machine learning (ML)
based solutions. To that end, this paper proposes a novel optimized ML-based
framework to detect botnets based on their corresponding DNS queries. More
specifically, the framework consists of using information gain as a feature
selection method and genetic algorithm (GA) as a hyper-parameter optimization
model to tune the parameters of a random forest (RF) classifier. The proposed
framework is evaluated using a state-of-the-art TI-2016 DNS dataset.
Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework reduced the
feature set size by up to 60%. Moreover, it achieved a high detection accuracy,
precision, recall, and F-score compared to the default classifier. This
highlights the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in
detecting botnet attacks."
"The recently proposed {\em cybersecurity dynamics} approach aims to
understand cybersecurity from a holistic perspective by modeling the evolution
of the global cybersecurity state. These models describe the interactions
between the various kinds of cyber defenses and the various kinds of cyber
attacks. We study a particular kind of cybersecurity dynamics caused by the
interactions between preventive and reactive defenses (e.g., filtering and
malware detection) against push- and pull-based cyber attacks (e.g., malware
spreading and ""drive-by download"" attacks). The dynamics was previously shown
to be globally stable in a {\em special} regime of the parameter universe, but
little is known beyond this special regime. In this paper, we resolve an open
problem in this domain by proving that the dynamics is globally stable in the
{\em entire} parameter universe (i.e., the dynamics always converges to a
unique equilibrium). We discuss the cybersecurity meanings and implications of
this theoretic result. We also prove that the dynamics converges {\em
exponentially} to the equilibrium except for a special parameter regime, in
which case the dynamics converges {\em polynomially}. Since it is often
difficult to compute the equilibrium, we propose new bounds of the equilibrium
and numerically show that these bounds are tighter than those proposed in the
literature."
"Mobile devices have become very popular nowadays, due to its portability and
high performance, a mobile device became a must device for persons using
information and communication technologies. In addition to hardware rapid
evolution, mobile applications are also increasing in their complexity and
performance to cover most needs of their users. Both software and hardware
design focused on increasing performance and the working hours of a mobile
device. Different mobile operating systems are being used today with different
platforms and different market shares. Like all information systems, mobile
systems are prone to malware attacks. Due to the personality feature of mobile
devices, malware detection is very important and is a must tool in each device
to protect private data and mitigate attacks. In this paper, analysis of
different malware detection techniques used for mobile operating systems is
provides. The focus of the analysis will be on the to two competing mobile
operating systems - Android and iOS. Finally, an assessment of each technique
and a summary of its advantages and disadvantages is provided. The aim of the
work is to establish a basis for developing a mobile malware detection tool
based on user profiling."
"Distributed control systems (DCS) and supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems were developed to reduce labour costs, and to allow
system-wide monitoring and remote control from a central location. Control
systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid,
natural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be
vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating
consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems.
American Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA
Test Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect
SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing
cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the
report AGA 12 part 1. The AGA 12 part 2 has been transferred to IEEE P1711.
This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA
standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms
in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We
then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems
which include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast
channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency
channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that
SCADA systems have."
"Identifying, analyzing, and evaluating cybersecurity risks are essential to
assess the vulnerabilities of modern manufacturing infrastructures and to
devise effective decision-making strategies to secure critical manufacturing
against potential cyberattacks. In response, this work proposes a
graph-theoretic approach for risk modeling and assessment to address the lack
of quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment frameworks for smart
manufacturing systems. In doing so, first, threat attributes are represented
using an attack graphical model derived from manufacturing cyberattack
taxonomies. Attack taxonomies offer consistent structures to categorize threat
attributes, and the graphical approach helps model their interdependence.
Second, the graphs are analyzed to explore how threat events can propagate
through the manufacturing value chain and identify the manufacturing assets
that threat actors can access and compromise during a threat event. Third, the
proposed method identifies the attack path that maximizes the likelihood of
success and minimizes the attack detection probability, and then computes the
associated cybersecurity risk. Finally, the proposed risk modeling and
assessment framework is demonstrated via an interconnected smart manufacturing
system illustrative example. Using the proposed approach, practitioners can
identify critical connections and manufacturing assets requiring prioritized
security controls and develop and deploy appropriate defense measures
accordingly."
"Since the burgeoning days of IoT, Mirai has been established as the canonical
IoT botnet. Not long after the public release of its code, researchers found
many Mirai variants compete with one another for many of the same vulnerable
hosts. Over time, the myriad Mirai variants evolved to incorporate unique
vulnerabilities, defenses, and regional concentrations. In this paper, we ask:
have Mirai variants evolved to the point that they are fundamentally distinct?
We answer this question by measuring two of the most popular Mirai descendants:
Hajime and Mozi. To actively scan both botnets simultaneously, we developed a
robust measurement infrastructure, BMS, and ran it for more than eight months.
The resulting datasets show that these two popular botnets have diverged in
their evolutions from their common ancestor in multiple ways: they have
virtually no overlapping IP addresses, they exhibit different behavior to
network events such as diurnal rate limiting in China, and more. Collectively,
our results show that there is no longer one canonical IoT botnet. We discuss
the implications of this finding for researchers and practitioners."
"Children are increasingly using the internet nowadays. While internet use
exposes children to various privacy and security risks, few studies have
examined how parents perceive and address their children's cybersecurity risks.
To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 25 parents living in
Norway with children aged between 10 to 15. We conducted semi-structured
interviews with the parents and performed a thematic analysis of the interview
data. The results of this paper include a list of cybersecurity awareness needs
for children from a parental perspective, a list of learning resources for
children, and a list of challenges for parents to ensure cybersecurity at home.
Our results are useful for developers and educators in developing cybersecurity
solutions for children. Future research should focus on defining cybersecurity
theories and practices that contribute to children's and parents' awareness
about cybersecurity risks, needs, and solutions."
"In place of in-house solutions, organizations are increasingly moving towards
managed services for cyber defense. Security Operations Centers are specialized
cybersecurity units responsible for the defense of an organization, but the
large-scale centralization of threat detection is causing SOCs to endure an
overwhelming amount of false positive alerts -- a phenomenon known as alert
fatigue. Large collections of imprecise sensors, an inability to adapt to known
false positives, evolution of the threat landscape, and inefficient use of
analyst time all contribute to the alert fatigue problem. To combat these
issues, we present That Escalated Quickly (TEQ), a machine learning framework
that reduces alert fatigue with minimal changes to SOC workflows by predicting
alert-level and incident-level actionability. On real-world data, the system is
able to reduce the time it takes to respond to actionable incidents by
$22.9\%$, suppress $54\%$ of false positives with a $95.1\%$ detection rate,
and reduce the number of alerts an analyst needs to investigate within singular
incidents by $14\%$."
"Cyber security is one of the most significant challenges in connected
vehicular systems and connected vehicles are prone to different cybersecurity
attacks that endanger passengers' safety. Cyber security in intelligent
connected vehicles is composed of in-vehicle security and security of
inter-vehicle communications. Security of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and
the Control Area Network (CAN) bus are the most significant parts of in-vehicle
security. Besides, with the development of 4G LTE and 5G remote communication
technologies for vehicle-toeverything (V2X) communications, the security of
inter-vehicle communications is another potential problem. After giving a short
introduction to the architecture of next-generation vehicles including
driverless and intelligent vehicles, this review paper identifies a few major
security attacks on the intelligent connected vehicles. Based on these attacks,
we provide a comprehensive survey of available defences against these attacks
and classify them into four categories, i.e. cryptography, network security,
software vulnerability detection, and malware detection. We also explore the
future directions for preventing attacks on intelligent vehicle systems."
"We implemented and evaluated an automated cyber defense agent. The agent
takes security alerts as input and uses reinforcement learning to learn a
policy for executing predefined defensive measures. The defender policies were
trained in an environment intended to simulate a cyber attack. In the
simulation, an attacking agent attempts to capture targets in the environment,
while the defender attempts to protect them by enabling defenses. The
environment was modeled using attack graphs based on the Meta Attack Language
language. We assumed that defensive measures have downtime costs, meaning that
the defender agent was penalized for using them. We also assumed that the
environment was equipped with an imperfect intrusion detection system that
occasionally produces erroneous alerts based on the environment state. To
evaluate the setup, we trained the defensive agent with different volumes of
intrusion detection system noise. We also trained agents with different
attacker strategies and graph sizes. In experiments, the defensive agent using
policies trained with reinforcement learning outperformed agents using
heuristic policies. Experiments also demonstrated that the policies could
generalize across different attacker strategies. However, the performance of
the learned policies decreased as the attack graphs increased in size."
"Threat information sharing is considered as one of the proactive defensive
approaches for enhancing the overall security of trusted partners. Trusted
partner organizations can provide access to past and current cybersecurity
threats for reducing the risk of a potential cyberattack - the requirements for
threat information sharing range from simplistic sharing of documents to threat
intelligence sharing. Therefore, the storage and sharing of highly sensitive
threat information raises considerable concerns regarding constructing a
secure, trusted threat information exchange infrastructure. Establishing a
trusted ecosystem for threat sharing will promote the validity, security,
anonymity, scalability, latency efficiency, and traceability of the stored
information that protects it from unauthorized disclosure. This paper proposes
a system that ensures the security principles mentioned above by utilizing a
distributed ledger technology that provides secure decentralized operations
through smart contracts and provides a privacy-preserving ecosystem for threat
information storage and sharing regarding the MITRE ATT\&CK framework."
"Penetration testing increases the security of systems through tasking testers
to 'think like the adversary' and attempt to find the ways that an attacker
would break into the system. For many systems, this can be conducted in a safe
and controlled way; however, some systems are so critical to human life and
safety that the risk of their failure or disablement due to active penetration
testing cannot be assumed. These systems are also critical to evaluate the
security of, to prevent attackers from disabling them or causing their
maloperation; however, this must be done in a manner that doesn't risk the very
malady that testing seeks to avoid through the testing process itself. This
paper presents P2SCP, a paradigm for penetration testing of systems that cannot
be subjected to the risk of penetration testing. It discusses how data
collection, the creation of digital twins and cousins and evaluative analysis
can be utilized to conduct virtual penetration tests on critical infrastructure
systems. This proposed paradigm is analyzed through the use of several case
studies."
"Electric power delivery relies on a communications backbone that must be
secure. SCADA systems are essential to critical grid functions and include
industrial control systems (ICS) protocols such as the Distributed Network
Protocol-3 (DNP3). These protocols are vulnerable to cyber threats that power
systems, as cyber-physical critical infrastructure, must be protected against.
For this reason, the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standard CIP-005-5
specifies that an electronic system perimeter is needed, accomplished with
firewalls. This paper presents how these electronic system perimeters can be
optimally found and generated using a proposed meta-heuristic approach for
optimal security zone formation for large-scale power systems. Then, to
implement the optimal firewall rules in a large scale power system model, this
work presents a prototype software tool that takes the optimization results and
auto-configures the firewall nodes for different utilities in a cyber-physical
testbed. Using this tool, firewall policies are configured for all the
utilities and their substations within a synthetic 2000-bus model, assuming two
different network topologies. Results generate the optimal electronic security
perimeters to protect a power system's data flows and compare the number of
firewalls, monetary cost, and risk alerts from path analysis."
"Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different
types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, and botnets. To reduce the
probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense
mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does
not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of
residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality,
an Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to
non-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware
crash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by
a naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks
only due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an
Internet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard
optimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to
be sub-optimal for himself. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing
cyber-insurance solutions when a user faces risks due to both, security as well
as non-security related failures. We propose \emph{Aegis}, a novel
cyber-insurance model in which the user accepts a fraction \emph{(strictly
positive)} of loss recovery on himself and transfers rest of the loss recovery
on the cyber-insurance agency. We mathematically show that given an option,
Internet users would prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-insurance
contracts, under all premium types. This result firmly establishes the
non-existence of traditional cyber-insurance markets when Aegis contracts are
offered to users."
"Malware still constitutes a major threat in the cybersecurity landscape, also
due to the widespread use of infection vectors such as documents. These
infection vectors hide embedded malicious code to the victim users,
facilitating the use of social engineering techniques to infect their machines.
Research showed that machine-learning algorithms provide effective detection
mechanisms against such threats, but the existence of an arms race in
adversarial settings has recently challenged such systems. In this work, we
focus on malware embedded in PDF files as a representative case of such an arms
race. We start by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the different
approaches used to generate PDF malware, and of the corresponding
learning-based detection systems. We then categorize threats specifically
targeted against learning-based PDF malware detectors, using a well-established
framework in the field of adversarial machine learning. This framework allows
us to categorize known vulnerabilities of learning-based PDF malware detectors
and to identify novel attacks that may threaten such systems, along with the
potential defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of such threats. We
conclude the paper by discussing how such findings highlight promising research
directions towards tackling the more general challenge of designing robust
malware detectors in adversarial settings."
"Edge nodes are crucial for detection against multitudes of cyber attacks on
Internet-of-Things endpoints and is set to become part of a multi-billion
industry. The resource constraints in this novel network infrastructure tier
constricts the deployment of existing Network Intrusion Detection System with
Deep Learning models (DLM). We address this issue by developing a novel light,
fast and accurate 'Edge-Detect' model, which detects Distributed Denial of
Service attack on edge nodes using DLM techniques. Our model can work within
resource restrictions i.e. low power, memory and processing capabilities, to
produce accurate results at a meaningful pace. It is built by creating layers
of Long Short-Term Memory or Gated Recurrent Unit based cells, which are known
for their excellent representation of sequential data. We designed a practical
data science pipeline with Recurring Neural Network to learn from the network
packet behavior in order to identify whether it is normal or attack-oriented.
The model evaluation is from deployment on actual edge node represented by
Raspberry Pi using current cybersecurity dataset (UNSW2015). Our results
demonstrate that in comparison to conventional DLM techniques, our model
maintains a high testing accuracy of 99% even with lower resource utilization
in terms of cpu and memory. In addition, it is nearly 3 times smaller in size
than the state-of-art model and yet requires a much lower testing time."
"Package theft detection has been a challenging task mainly due to lack of
training data and a wide variety of package theft cases in reality. In this
paper, we propose a new Global and Local Fusion Package Theft Detection
Embedding (GLF-PTDE) framework to generate package theft scores for each
segment within a video to fulfill the real-world requirements on package theft
detection. Moreover, we construct a novel Package Theft Detection dataset to
facilitate the research on this task. Our method achieves 80% AUC performance
on the newly proposed dataset, showing the effectiveness of the proposed
GLF-PTDE framework and its robustness in different real scenes for package
theft detection."
"The growing popularity of smart mobile devices such as smartphones and
tablets has made them an attractive target for cyber-criminals, resulting in a
rapidly growing and evolving mobile threat as attackers experiment with new
business models by targeting mobile users. With the emergence of the first
large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to
distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack.
Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells
introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core
network. In this paper, we present the NEMESYS approach to smart mobile network
security. The goal of the NEMESYS project is to develop novel security
technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem,
and to improve mobile network security through a better understanding of the
threat landscape. To this purpose, NEMESYS will collect and analyze information
about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting smart mobile devices and the core
network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We are developing a
data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots
and honeyclients in order to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile
attacks and understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile
devices. By correlating the extracted information with known attack patterns
from wireline networks, we plan to reveal and identify the possible shift in
the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against smart mobile devices."
"Cyber threat hunting is a proactive search process for hidden threats in the
organization's information system. It is a crucial component of active defense
against advanced persistent threats (APTs). However, most of the current threat
hunting methods rely on Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI), which can find known
attacks but cannot find unknown attacks that have not been disclosed by CTI. In
this paper, we propose LogKernel, a threat hunting method based on graph kernel
clustering which can effectively separates attack behaviour from benign
activities. LogKernel first abstracts system audit logs into Behaviour
Provenance Graphs (BPGs), and then clusters graphs by embedding them into a
continuous space using a graph kernel. In particular, we design a new graph
kernel clustering method based on the characteristics of BPGs, which can
capture structure information and rich label information of the BPGs. To reduce
false positives, LogKernel further quantifies the threat of abnormal behaviour.
We evaluate LogKernel on the malicious dataset which includes seven simulated
attack scenarios and the DAPRA CADETS dataset which includes four attack
scenarios. The result shows that LogKernel can hunt all attack scenarios among
them, and compared to the state-of-the-art methods, it can find unknown
attacks."
"This paper examines the current state of the science underlying cybersecurity
research with an emphasis on the non-signature-based intrusion detection
domain. First, the paper re-examines the base-rate fallacy originally published
by Axelsson, putting the impact of false positives into context. Given the
relative high numbers of false positives, the paper argues for deeper analysis
of false positives, akin to the analysis that true positives are treated to.
The second section of the paper examines the metrics being used to analyze
non-signature intrusion detection techniques, the current status quo of
employed metrics, and the impact of the status quo on scientific advancement.
Finally, the paper analyzes the use of online attack graphs and their
applicability, especially in scenarios of constrained environments, such as
Internet of Things devices. The use of offline attack graphs in such
constrained environments is also examined. In essence, a deep dive review
identified multiple areas throughout the field in which the effectiveness and
validity of the scientific method can be greatly improved, e.g., through
removal of logical fallacies."
"Education and training in digital forensics requires a variety of suitable
challenge corpora containing realistic features including regular
wear-and-tear, background noise, and the actual digital traces to be discovered
during investigation. Typically, the creation of these challenges requires
overly arduous effort on the part of the educator to ensure their viability.
Once created, the challenge image needs to be stored and distributed to a class
for practical training. This storage and distribution step requires significant
time and resources and may not even be possible in an online/distance learning
scenario due to the data sizes involved. As part of this paper, we introduce a
more capable methodology and system as an alternative to current approaches.
EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage
and distribution of challenges for digital forensics education and training.
The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images
containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for
students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and
perform a ""diffing"" of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process
extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an
""evidence package"". Evidence packages can be created for different personae,
different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence
packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A
number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for
tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also
discussed as a result of using EviPlant."
"Since 2010, multiple cyber incidents on industrial infrastructure, such as
Stuxnet and CrashOverride, have exposed the vulnerability of Industrial Control
Systems (ICS) to cyber threats. The industrial systems are commissioned for
longer duration amounting to decades, often resulting in non-compliance to
technological advancements in industrial cybersecurity mechanisms. The
unavailability of network infrastructure information makes designing the
security policies or configuring the cybersecurity countermeasures such as
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) challenging. An empirical solution
is to self-learn the network infrastructure information of an industrial system
from its monitored network traffic to make the network transparent for
downstream analyses tasks such as anomaly detection. In this work, a
Python-based industrial communication paradigm-aware framework, named PROFINET
Operations Enumeration and Tracking (POET), that enumerates different
industrial operations executed in a deterministic order of a PROFINET-based
industrial system is reported. The operation-driving industrial network
protocol frames are dissected for enumeration of the operations. For the
requirements of capturing the transitions between industrial operations
triggered by the communication events, the Finite State Machines (FSM) are
modelled to enumerate the PROFINET operations of the device, connection and
system. POET extracts the network information from network traffic to
instantiate appropriate FSM models (Device, Connection or System) and track the
industrial operations. It successfully detects and reports the anomalies
triggered by a network attack in a miniaturized PROFINET-based industrial
system, executed through valid network protocol exchanges and resulting in
invalid PROFINET operation transition for the device."
"Smart grid is an alternative solution of the conventional power grid which
harnesses the power of the information technology to save the energy and meet
today's environment requirements. Due to the inherent vulnerabilities in the
information technology, the smart grid is exposed to a wide variety of threats
that could be translated into cyber-attacks. In this paper, we develop a deep
learning-based intrusion detection system to defend against cyber-attacks in
the advanced metering infrastructure network. The proposed machine learning
approach is trained and tested extensively on an empirical industrial dataset
which is composed of several attack categories including the scanning, buffer
overflow, and denial of service attacks. Then, an experimental comparison in
terms of detection accuracy is conducted to evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.
The obtained results suggest that the proposed approaches produce optimal
results comparing to the other algorithms. Finally, we propose a network
architecture to deploy the proposed anomaly-based intrusion detection system
across the Advanced Metering Infrastructure network. In addition, we propose a
network security architecture composed of two types of Intrusion detection
system types, Host and Network-based, deployed across the Advanced Metering
Infrastructure network to inspect the traffic and detect the malicious one at
all the levels."
"The lack of guided exercises and practical opportunities to learn about
cybersecurity in a practical way makes it difficult for security experts to
improve their proficiency. Capture the Flag events and Cyber Ranges are ideal
for cybersecurity training. Thereby, the participants usually compete in teams
against each other, or have to defend themselves in a specific scenario. As
organizers of yearly events, we present a taxonomy for interactive cyber
training and education. The proposed taxonomy includes different factors of the
technical setup, audience, training environment, and training setup. By the
comprehensive taxonomy, different aspects of interactive training are
considered. This can help trainings to improve and to be established
successfully. The provided taxonomy is extendable and can be used in further
application areas as research on new security technologies."
"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently gained wide attention in
cybersecurity, particularly in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and cyber
automation. Increased connection and automation have revolutionized the world's
economic and cultural infrastructures, while they have introduced risks in
terms of cyber attacks. CTI is information that helps cybersecurity analysts
make intelligent security decisions, that is often delivered in the form of
natural language text, which must be transformed to machine readable format
through an automated procedure before it can be used for automated security
measures.
  This paper proposes SecureBERT, a cybersecurity language model capable of
capturing text connotations in cybersecurity text (e.g., CTI) and therefore
successful in automation for many critical cybersecurity tasks that would
otherwise rely on human expertise and time-consuming manual efforts. SecureBERT
has been trained using a large corpus of cybersecurity text.To make SecureBERT
effective not just in retaining general English understanding, but also when
applied to text with cybersecurity implications, we developed a customized
tokenizer as well as a method to alter pre-trained weights. The SecureBERT is
evaluated using the standard Masked Language Model (MLM) test as well as two
additional standard NLP tasks. Our evaluation studies show that
SecureBERT\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT}}
outperforms existing similar models, confirming its capability for solving
crucial NLP tasks in cybersecurity."
"Electric energy systems are undergoing significant changes to improve system
reliability and accommodate increasing power demands. The penetration of
distributed energy resources (DERs) including roof-top solar panels, energy
storage, electric vehicles, etc., enables the on-site generation of
economically dispatchable power curtailing operational costs. The effective
control of DERs requires communication between utilities and DER system
operators. The communication protocols employed for DER management and control
lack sophisticated cybersecurity features and can compromise power systems
secure operation if malicious control commands are issued to DERs. To overcome
authentication-related protocol issues, we present a bolt-on security extension
that can be implemented on Distributed Network Protocol v3 (DNP3). We port an
authentication framework, DERauth, into DNP3, and utilize real-time
measurements from a simulated DER battery energy storage system to enhance
communication security. We evaluate our framework in a testbed setup using DNP3
master and outstation devices performing secure authentication by leveraging
the entropy of DERs."
"The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection and
cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet
infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet
to cover the real-world, enabling many new services that will improve people's
everyday lives, spawn new businesses and make buildings, cities and transport
smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking,
but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already
now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented
correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive
privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid
ubiquitous tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in
the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving
features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing
their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in
this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to
ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality."
"Ensuring privacy of users of social networks is probably an unsolvable
conundrum. At the same time, an informed use of the existing privacy options by
the social network participants may alleviate - or even prevent - some of the
more drastic privacy-averse incidents. Unfortunately, recent surveys show that
an average user is either not aware of these options or does not use them,
probably due to their perceived complexity. It is therefore reasonable to
believe that tools assisting users with two tasks: 1) understanding their
social net behavior in terms of their privacy settings and broad privacy
categories, and 2)recommending reasonable privacy options, will be a valuable
tool for everyday privacy practice in a social network context. This paper
presents YourPrivacyProtector, a recommender system that shows how simple
machine learning techniques may provide useful assistance in these two tasks to
Facebook users. We support our claim with empirical results of application of
YourPrivacyProtector to two groups of Facebook users."
"Due to its critical role in cybersecurity, digital forensics has received
significant attention from researchers and practitioners alike. The ever
increasing sophistication of modern cyberattacks is directly related to the
complexity of evidence acquisition, which often requires the use of several
technologies. To date, researchers have presented many surveys and reviews on
the field. However, such articles focused on the advances of each particular
domain of digital forensics individually. Therefore, while each of these
surveys facilitates researchers and practitioners to keep up with the latest
advances in a particular domain of digital forensics, the global perspective is
missing. Aiming to fill this gap, we performed a qualitative review of reviews
in the field of digital forensics, determined the main topics on digital
forensics topics and identified their main challenges. Our analysis provides
enough evidence to prove that the digital forensics community could benefit
from closer collaborations and cross-topic research, since it is apparent that
researchers and practitioners are trying to find solutions to the same problems
in parallel, sometimes without noticing it."
"Sentiment Analysis provides an opportunity to understand the subject(s),
especially in the digital age, due to an abundance of public data and effective
algorithms. Cybersecurity is a subject where opinions are plentiful and
differing in the public domain. This descriptive research analyzed
cybersecurity content on Twitter and Reddit to measure its sentiment, positive
or negative, or neutral. The data from Twitter and Reddit was amassed via
technology-specific APIs during a selected timeframe to create datasets, which
were then analyzed individually for their sentiment by VADER, an NLP (Natural
Language Processing) algorithm. A random sample of cybersecurity content (ten
tweets and posts) was also classified for sentiments by twenty human annotators
to evaluate the performance of VADER. Cybersecurity content on Twitter was at
least 48% positive, and Reddit was at least 26.5% positive. The positive or
neutral content far outweighed negative sentiments across both platforms. When
compared to human classification, which was considered the standard or source
of truth, VADER produced 60% accuracy for Twitter and 70% for Reddit in
assessing the sentiment; in other words, some agreement between algorithm and
human classifiers. Overall, the goal was to explore an uninhibited research
topic about cybersecurity sentiment"
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can support
the span of indicator-level, e.g. anomaly detection, to behavioral level cyber
security modeling and inference. This contribution is based on a dataset named
BRON which is amalgamated from public threat and vulnerability behavioral
sources. We demonstrate how BRON can support prediction of related threat
techniques and attack patterns. We also discuss other AI and ML uses of BRON to
exploit its behavioral knowledge."
"Sophisticated cyber attacks present significant challenges for organizations
in detecting and preventing such threats. To address this critical need for
advanced defense mechanisms, we propose an Ensemble Defense System (EDS). An
EDS is a cybersecurity framework aggregating multiple security tools designed
to monitor and alert an organization during cyber attacks. The proposed EDS
leverages a comprehensive range of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
capabilities by introducing a hybrid of signature-based IDS and anomaly-based
IDS tools. It also incorporates Elasticsearch, an open-source Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, to facilitate data analysis and
interactive visualization of alerts generated from IDSs. The effectiveness of
the EDS is evaluated through a payload from a bash script that executes various
attacks, including port scanning, privilege escalation, and Denial-of-Service
(DoS). The evaluation demonstrates the EDS's ability to detect diverse cyber
attacks."
"Network intrusion detection systems and antivirus software are essential in
detecting malicious network traffic and attacks such as denial-of-service and
malwares. Each attack, worm or virus has its own distinctive signature.
Signature-based intrusion detection and antivirus systems depend on pattern
matching to look for possible attack signatures. Pattern matching is a very
complex task, which requires a lot of time, memory and computing resources.
Software-based intrusion detection is not fast enough to match high network
speeds and the increasing number of attacks. In this paper, we propose special
purpose hardware for Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. FPGAs form an
excellent choice because of their massively parallel structure, reprogrammable
logic and memory resources. The hardware is designed in Verilog and implemented
using Xilinx ISE. For evaluation, we dope network traffic traces collected
using Wireshark with 2500 signatures from the ClamAV virus definitions
database. Experimental results show high speed that reaches up to 216 Mbps. In
addition, we evaluate time, device usage, and power consumption."
"Among many prevailing malware, crypto-ransomware poses a significant threat
as it financially extorts affected users by creating denial of access via
unauthorized encryption of their documents as well as holding their documents
hostage and financially extorting them. This results in millions of dollars of
annual losses worldwide. Multiple variants of ransomware are growing in number
with capabilities of evasion from many anti-viruses and software-only malware
detection schemes that rely on static execution signatures. In this paper, we
propose a hardware-assisted scheme, called RanStop, for early detection of
crypto-ransomware infection in commodity processors. RanStop leverages the
information of hardware performance counters embedded in the performance
monitoring unit in modern processors to observe micro-architectural event sets
and detects known and unknown crypto-ransomware variants. In this paper, we
train a recurrent neural network-based machine learning architecture using long
short-term memory (LSTM) model for analyzing micro-architectural events in the
hardware domain when executing multiple variants of ransomware as well as
benign programs. We create timeseries to develop intrinsic statistical features
using the information of related HPCs and improve the detection accuracy of
RanStop and reduce noise by via LSTM and global average pooling. As an early
detection scheme, RanStop can accurately and quickly identify ransomware within
2ms from the start of the program execution by analyzing HPC information
collected for 20 timestamps each 100us apart. This detection time is too early
for a ransomware to make any significant damage, if none. Moreover, validation
against benign programs with behavioral (sub-routine-centric) similarity with
that of a crypto-ransomware shows that RanStop can detect ransomware with an
average of 97% accuracy for fifty random trials."
"Sensemaking is a critical activity in organizations. It is a process through
which individuals ascribe meanings to events which forms the basis to
facilitate collective action. However, the role of organizations, technology
and individuals and their interaction in the process of sensemaking has not
been sufficiently explored. This novel study seeks to address this gap by
proposing a framework that explains how the interplay among organizations,
technology and individuals enables sensemaking in the process of cybersecurity
incident response. We propose that Organizations, Technology, and Individuals
are the key components that interact in various ways to facilitate enactment,
selection and retention activities (Sensemaking activities) in Incident
Response. We argue that sensemaking in Incident Response is the outcome of this
interaction. This interaction allows organizations to respond to cybersecurity
incidents in a comprehensive manner."
"Capture the Flag challenges are a popular form of cybersecurity education,
where students solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting. The
tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking
passwords, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the
skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula
defined by security experts. We explain the significance of Capture the Flag
challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solutions
collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them to
well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which skills the
challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity topics, their
variance in different challenge formats, and their development over the past
years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge about
cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social
engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the
implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our
results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include
non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract
a broader audience to cybersecurity."
"Security ceremonies still fail despite decades of efforts by researchers and
practitioners. Attacks are often a cunning amalgam of exploits for technical
systems and of forms of human behaviour. For example, this is the case with the
recent news headline of a large-scale attack against Electrum Bitcoin wallets,
which manages to spread a malicious update of the wallet app. I therefore set
out to look at things through a different lens. I make the (metaphorical)
hypothesis that human ancestors arrived on Earth along with security ceremonies
from a very far planet, the Cybersecurity planet. My hypothesis continues, in
that studying (by huge telescopes) the surface of Cybersecurity in combination
with the logical projection on that surface of what happens on Earth is
beneficial for us earthlings. I have spotted four cities so far on the remote
planet. Democratic City features security ceremonies that allow inhabitants to
follow personal paths of practice and, for example, make errors or be driven by
emotions. By contrast, security ceremonies in Dictatorial City compel
inhabitants to comply, thus behaving like programmed automata. Security
ceremonies in Beautiful City are so beautiful that inhabitants just love to
follow them precisely. Invisible City has security ceremonies that are not
perceivable, hence inhabitants feel like they never encounter any.
Incidentally, we use the words ""democratic"" and ""dictatorial"" without any
political connotation. A key argument I shall develop is that all cities but
Democratic City address the human factor, albeit in different ways. In the
light of these findings, I will also discuss security ceremonies of our planet,
such as WhatsApp web login and flight boarding, and explore room for improving
them based upon the current understanding of Cybersecurity."
"Recent high-profile cyberattacks on energy infrastructures, such as the
security breach of the Colonial Pipeline in 2021 and attacks that have
disrupted Ukraine's power grid from the mid-2010s till date, have pushed
cybersecurity as a top priority. As political tensions have escalated in Europe
this year, concerns about critical infrastructure security have increased.
Operators in the industrial sector face new cybersecurity threats that increase
the risk of disruptions in services, property damages, and environmental harm.
Amid rising geopolitical tensions, industrial companies, with their
network-connected systems, are now considered major targets for adversaries to
advance political, social, or military agendas. Moreover, the recent
Russian-Ukrainian conflict has set the alarm worldwide about the danger of
targeting energy grids via cyberattacks. Attack methodologies, techniques, and
procedures used successfully to hack energy grids in Ukraine can be used
elsewhere. This work aims to present a thorough analysis of the cybersecurity
of the energy infrastructure amid the increased rise of cyberwars. The article
navigates through the recent history of energy-related cyberattacks and their
reasoning, discusses the grid's vulnerability, and makes a precautionary
argument for securing the grids against them."
"Since 1981, when Lamport introduced the remote user authentication scheme
using table, a plenty of schemes had been proposed with table and without table
using. In 1993, Chang and Wu [5] introduced Remote password authentication
scheme with smart cards. A number of remote authentication schemes with smart
cards have been proposed since then. These schemes allow a valid user to login
a remote server and access the services provided by the remote server. But
still there is no scheme to authenticate the remote proxy user. In this paper
we propose firstly, a protocol to authenticate a proxy user remotely using
smartcards."
"Personal mobility data from mobile phones and other sensors are increasingly
used to inform policymaking during pandemics, natural disasters, and other
humanitarian crises. However, even aggregated mobility traces can reveal
private information about individual movements to potentially malicious actors.
This paper develops and tests an approach for releasing private mobility data,
which provides formal guarantees over the privacy of the underlying subjects.
Specifically, we (1) introduce an algorithm for constructing differentially
private mobility matrices, and derive privacy and accuracy bounds on this
algorithm; (2) use real-world data from mobile phone operators in Afghanistan
and Rwanda to show how this algorithm can enable the use of private mobility
data in two high-stakes policy decisions: pandemic response and the
distribution of humanitarian aid; and (3) discuss practical decisions that need
to be made when implementing this approach, such as how to optimally balance
privacy and accuracy. Taken together, these results can help enable the
responsible use of private mobility data in humanitarian response."
"As device interconnectivity and ubiquitous computing continues to proliferate
healthcare, the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), also well known as the,
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) or the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT),
is certain to play a major role in the health, and well-being of billions of
people across the globe. When it comes to issues of cybersecurity risks and
threats connected to the IoT in all of its various flavors the emphasis has
been on technical challenges and technical solution. However, especially in the
area of healthcare there is another substantial and potentially grave
challenge. It is the challenge of thoroughly and accurately communicating the
nature and extent of cybersecurity risks and threats to patients who are
reliant upon these interconnected healthcare technologies to improve and even
preserve their lives. This case study was conducted to assess the scope and
depth of cybersecurity risk and threat communications delivered to an extremely
vulnerable patient population, semi-structured interviews were held with
cardiac medical device specialists across the United States. This research
contributes scientific data in the field of healthcare cybersecurity and
assists scholars and practitioners in advancing education and research in the
field of MIoT patient communications."
"This paper identifies an intrusion surveillance framework which provides an
analyst with the ability to investigate and monitor cyber-attacks in a covert
manner. Where cyber-attacks are perpetrated for the purposes of espionage the
ability to understand an adversary's techniques and objectives are an important
element in network and computer security. With the appropriate toolset,
security investigators would be permitted to perform both live and stealthy
counter-intelligence operations by observing the behaviour and communications
of the intruder. Subsequently a more complete picture of the attacker's
identity, objectives, capabilities, and infiltration could be formulated than
is possible with present technologies. This research focused on developing an
extensible framework to permit the covert investigation of malware.
Additionally, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) Mass Storage Device (MSD) based
covert channel was designed to enable remote command and control of the
framework. The work was validated through the design, implementation and
testing of a toolset."
"With the rise of cyber threats, cyber insurance is becoming an important
consideration for businesses. However, research on cyber insurance risk has so
far been hindered by the general lack of data, as well as limitations
underlying what limited data are available publicly. Specifically and of
particular importance to cyber insurance modelling, limitations arising from
lack of information regarding (i) delays in reporting, (ii) all businesses
affected by third-party events, and (iii) changes in reporting propensity. In
this paper, we fill this important gap by utilising an underrecognised set of
public data provided by U.S. state Attorneys General, and provide new insights
on the true scale of cyber insurance risk. These data are collected based on
mandatory reporting requirements of data breaches, and contain substantial and
detailed information. We further discuss extensively the associated
implications of our findings for cyber insurance pricing, reserving,
underwriting, and experience monitoring."
"Advances of emerging Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
technologies push the boundaries of what is possible and open up new markets
for innovative ICT products and services. The adoption of ICT products and
systems with security properties depends on consumers' confidence and markets'
trust in the security functionalities and whether the assurance measures
applied to these products meet the inherent security requirements. Such
confidence and trust are primarily gained through the rigorous development of
security requirements, validation criteria, evaluation, and certification.
Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (often referred
to as Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for
cyber security certification. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of
the CC standards and its adoptions. Adoption barriers of the CC are also
investigated based on the analysis of current trends in security evaluation.
Specifically, we share the experiences and lessons gained through the recent
Development of Australian Cyber Criteria Assessment (DACCA) project that
promotes the CC among stakeholders in ICT security products related to
specification, development, evaluation, certification and approval,
procurement, and deployment. Best practices on developing Protection Profiles,
recommendations, and future directions for trusted cybersecurity advancement
are presented."
"In today's business environment, it is difficult to imagine a workplace
without access to the web, yet a variety of email born viruses, spyware,
adware, Trojan horses, phishing attacks, directory harvest attacks, DoS
attacks, and other threats combine to attack businesses and customers. This
paper is an attempt to review phishing - a constantly growing and evolving
threat to Internet based commercial transactions. Various phishing approaches
that include vishing, spear phishng, pharming, keyloggers, malware, web
Trojans, and others will be discussed. This paper also highlights the latest
phishing analysis made by Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) and Korean
Internet Security Center."
"In this chapter, we review how the EU cybersecurity regulatory framework
impacts providers of cloud computing services. We examine the evolving
regulatory treatment of cloud services as an enabler of the EU's digital
economy and question whether all cloud services should be treated as critical
infrastructure. Further, we look at how the safeguarding and incident
notification obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR')
and the Network and Information Systems Directive ('NISD') apply to cloud
providers. We also consider the proposed revision of the NISD and look at newly
developed voluntary assurance mechanisms for cloud providers, including codes
of conduct and certification schemes. We conclude that, since cloud providers
are typically subject to both NISD and GDPR and to the jurisdiction of multiple
regulators, they face divergent regulatory approaches, which can lead to
unintended outcomes and high compliance costs."
"This study compares the National Cybersecurity Strategies (NCSSs) of publicly
available documents of ten nations across Europe (United Kingdom, France,
Lithuania, Estonia, Spain, and Norway), Asia-Pacific (Singapore and Australia),
and the American region (the United States of America and Canada). The study
observed that there is not a unified understanding of the term ""Cybersecurity"";
however, a common trajectory of the NCSSs shows that the fight against
cybercrime is a joint effort among various stakeholders, hence the need for
strong international cooperation. Using a comparative structure and an NCSS
framework, the research finds similarities in protecting critical assets,
commitment to research and development, and improved national and international
collaboration. The study finds that the lack of a unified underlying
cybersecurity framework leads to a disparity in the structure and contents of
the strategies. The strengths and weaknesses of the NCSSs from the research can
benefit countries planning to develop or update their cybersecurity strategies.
The study gives recommendations that strategy developers can consider when

"OAuth is the new de facto standard for delegating authorization in the web.
An important limitation of OAuth is the fact that it was designed for
authorization and not for authentication. The usage of OAuth for authentication
thus leads to serious vulnerabilities as shown by Zhou et. al. in [44] and Chen
et. al. in [9]. OpenID Connect was created on top of OAuth to fill this gap by
providing federated identity management and user authentication. OpenID Connect
was standardized in February 2014, but leading companies like Google,
Microsoft, AOL and PayPal are already using it in their web applications [1],
[2], [3], [30].
  In this paper we describe the OpenID Connect protocol and provide the first
in-depth analysis of one of the key features of OpenID Connect: the Discovery
and the Dynamic Registration extensions.We present a new class of attacks on
OpenID Connect that belong to the category of second-order vulnerabilities.
These attacks consist of two phases: First, the injection payload is stored by
the legitimate application. Later on, this payload is used in a
security-critical operation. Our new class of attacks - called Malicious
Endpoints attacks - exploits the OpenID Connect extensions Discovery and
Dynamic Registration. These attacks break user authentication, compromise user
privacy, and enable Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), client-side code
injection, and Denial-of-Service (DoS). As a result, the security of the OpenID
Connect protocol cannot be guaranteed when these extensions are enabled in
their present form.
  We contacted the authors of the OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications. They
acknowledged our Malicious Endpoint attacks and recognized the need to improve
the specification [29]. We are currently involved in the discussion regarding
the mitigation of the existing issues and an extension to the OAuth
specification."
"Encryption ransomware has become a notorious malware. It encrypts user data
on storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs) and demands a ransom to
restore data for users. To bypass existing defenses, ransomware would keep
evolving and performing new attack models. For instance, we identify and
validate three new attacks, including (1) garbage-collection (GC) attack that
exploits storage capacity and keeps writing data to trigger GC and force SSDs
to release the retained data; (2) timing attack that intentionally slows down
the pace of encrypting data and hides its I/O patterns to escape existing
defense; (3) trimming attack that utilizes the trim command available in SSDs
to physically erase data.
  To enhance the robustness of SSDs against these attacks, we propose RSSD, a
ransomware-aware SSD. It redesigns the flash management of SSDs for enabling
the hardware-assisted logging, which can conservatively retain older versions
of user data and received storage operations in time order with low overhead.
It also employs hardware-isolated NVMe over Ethernet to expand local storage
capacity by transparently offloading the logs to remote cloud/servers in a
secure manner. RSSD enables post-attack analysis by building a trusted evidence
chain of storage operations to assist the investigation of ransomware attacks.
We develop RSSD with a real-world SSD FPGA board. Our evaluation shows that
RSSD can defend against new and future ransomware attacks, while introducing
negligible performance overhead."
"This report deals with security in wireless sensor networks (WSNs),
especially in network layer. Multiple secure routing protocols have been
proposed in the literature. However, they often use the cryptography to secure
routing functionalities. The cryptography alone is not enough to defend against
multiple attacks due to the node compromise. Therefore, we need more
algorithmic solutions. In this report, we focus on the behavior of routing
protocols to determine which properties make them more resilient to attacks.
Our aim is to find some answers to the following questions. Are there any
existing protocols, not designed initially for security, but which already
contain some inherently resilient properties against attacks under which some
portion of the network nodes is compromised? If yes, which specific behaviors
are making these protocols more resilient? We propose in this report an
overview of security strategies for WSNs in general, including existing attacks
and defensive measures. In this report we focus at the network layer in
particular, and an analysis of the behavior of four particular routing
protocols is provided to determine their inherent resiliency to insider
attacks. The protocols considered are: Dynamic Source Routing (DSR),
Gradient-Based Routing (GBR), Greedy Forwarding (GF) and Random Walk Routing
(RWR)."
"Cybersecurity attacks are a major and increasing burden to economic and
social systems globally. Here we analyze the principles of security in
different domains and demonstrate an architectural flaw in current
cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the
ability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The
current architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate
transparently with one another, so security would require protecting every
computer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems
depend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police
patrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending
each individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides
security against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,
membranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We
propose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge.
This will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating
securityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b)
Modifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security
software that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune
system architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to
cybersecurity. Among these principles is a careful interplay of detection and
action that includes evolutionary improvement. However, achieving significant
security gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying the
underlying architectural limitations."
"Cybersecurity attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pose a
growing threat to individuals, and private and public sectors. Distributed
Denial of Service attacks are one of the most harmful of these threats in
today's internet, disrupting the availability of essential services. This
project presents a novel deep learning-based approach for detecting DDoS
attacks in network traffic using the industry-recognized DDoS evaluation
dataset from the University of New Brunswick, which contains packet captures
from real-time DDoS attacks, creating a broader and more applicable model for
the real world. The algorithm employed in this study exploits the properties of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and common deep learning algorithms to
build a novel mitigation technique that classifies benign and malicious
traffic. The proposed model preprocesses the data by extracting packet flows
and normalizing them to a fixed length which is fed into a custom architecture
containing layers regulating node dropout, normalization, and a sigmoid
activation function to out a binary classification. This allows for the model
to process the flows effectively and look for the nodes that contribute to DDoS
attacks while dropping the ""noise"" or the distractors. The results of this
study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting DDOS
attacks, achieving an accuracy of .9883 on 2000 unseen flows in network
traffic, while being scalable for any network environment."
"Cybersecurity operations, CyberOps, is the use and application of
cybersecurity capabilities to a domain, department, organisation or nation. It
is fundamentally to protect digital investments, contribute to national
economic wellbeing by providing a safe, secure and conducive environment to
conduct business and to protect national critical national infrastructures and
citizens welfare. In this paper, we investigate operational factors that
influence situational awareness of CyberOps, specifically, the features that
deals with understanding and comprehension of operational and human factors
aspects and that helps with insights on human operator decision making such as
cognition, teamwork, knowledge, skills and abilities. The operational factors
discussed in this paper range from tools, techniques, integration, architecture
to automation, cognition, people, policy, process and procedures."
"The popularity of wearable devices is growing exponentially, with consumers
using these for a variety of services. Fitness devices are currently offering
new services such as shopping or buying train tickets using contactless
payment. In addition, fitness devices are collecting a number of personal
information such as body temperature, pulse rate, food habits and body weight,
steps-distance travelled, calories burned and sleep stage. Although these
devices can offer convenience to consumers, more and more reports are warning
of the cybersecurity risks of such devices, and the possibilities for such
devices to be hacked and used as springboards to other systems. Due to their
wireless transmissions, these devices can potentially be vulnerable to a
malicious attack allowing the data collected to be exposed. The vulnerabilities
of these devices stem from lack of authentication, disadvantages of Bluetooth
connections, location tracking as well as third party vulnerabilities.
Guidelines do exist for securing such devices, but most of such guidance is
directed towards device manufacturers or IoT providers, while consumers are
often unaware of potential risks. The aim of this paper is to provide
cybersecurity guidelines for users in order to take measures to avoid risks
when using fitness devices."
"We model the risk posed by a malicious cyber-attacker seeking to induce grid
insecurity by means of a load redistribution attack, while explicitly
acknowledging that such an actor would plausibly base its decision strategy on
imperfect information. More specifically, we introduce a novel formulation for
the cyber-attacker's decision-making problem and analyze the distribution of
decisions taken with randomly inaccurate data on the grid branch admittances or
capacities, and the distribution of their respective impact. Our findings
indicate that inaccurate admittance values most often lead to suboptimal
cyber-attacks that still compromise the grid security, while inaccurate
capacity values result in notably less effective attacks. We also find common
attacked cyber-assets and common affected physical-assets between all (random)
imperfect cyber-attacks, which could be exploited in a preventive and/or
corrective sense for effective cyber-physical risk management."
"Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are becoming more and more important in
managing the operation of many important systems in smart manufacturing, such
as power stations, water supply systems, and manufacturing sites. While massive
digital data can be a driving force for system performance, data security has
raised serious concerns. Anomaly detection, therefore, is essential for
preventing network security intrusions and system attacks. Many AI-based
anomaly detection methods have been proposed and achieved high detection
performance, however, are still a ""black box"" that is hard to be interpreted.
In this study, we suggest using Explainable Artificial Intelligence to enhance
the perspective and reliable results of an LSTM-based Autoencoder-OCSVM
learning model for anomaly detection in ICS. We demonstrate the performance of
our proposed method based on a well-known SCADA dataset."
"Recent web-based cyber attacks are evolving into a new form of attacks such
as private information theft and DDoS attack exploiting JavaScript within a web
page. These attacks can be made just by accessing a web site without
distribution of malicious codes and infection. Script-based cyber attacks are
hard to detect with traditional security equipments such as Firewall and IPS
because they inject malicious scripts in a response message for a normal web
request. Furthermore, they are hard to trace because attacks such as DDoS can
be made just by visiting a web page. Due to these reasons, it is expected that
they could result in direct damages and great ripple effects. To cope with
these issues, in this article, a proposal is made for techniques that are used
to detect malicious scripts through real-time web content analysis and to
automatically generate detection signatures for malicious JavaScript."
"Software Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) Networks profits from
centralized management and interactive resource sharing which enhances the
efficiency and scalability of IoT applications. But with the rapid growth in
services and applications, it is vulnerable to possible attacks and faces
severe security challenges. Intrusion detection has been widely used to ensure
network security, but classical detection means are usually signature-based or
explicit-behavior-based and fail to detect unknown attacks intelligently, which
are hard to satisfy the requirements of SD-IoT Networks. In this paper, we
propose an AI-based two-stage intrusion detection empowered by software defined
technology. It flexibly captures network flows with a globle view and detects
attacks intelligently through applying AI algorithms. We firstly leverage Bat
algorithm with swarm division and Differential Mutation to select typical
features. Then, we exploit Random forest through adaptively altering the
weights of samples using weighted voting mechanism to classify flows.
Evaluation results prove that the modified intelligent algorithms select more
important features and achieve superior performance in flow classification. It
is also verified that intelligent intrusion detection shows better accuracy
with lower overhead comparied with existing solutions."
"We propose a disk encryption method, called secure disk mixed system (SDMS)
in this paper, for data protection of disk storages such as USB flash memory,
USB hard disk and CD/DVD. It is aimed to solve temporal and spatial limitation
problems of existing disk encryption methods and to control security
performance flexibly according to the security requirement of system. SDMS
stores data by encrypting with different encryption key per sector and updates
sector encryption keys each time data is written. Security performance of SDMS
is analyzed at the end of the paper."
"In an era where cyberspace is both a battleground and a backbone of modern
society, the urgency of safeguarding digital assets against ever-evolving
threats is paramount. This paper introduces Cyber Sentinel, an innovative
task-oriented cybersecurity dialogue system that is effectively capable of
managing two core functions: explaining potential cyber threats within an
organization to the user, and taking proactive/reactive security actions when
instructed by the user. Cyber Sentinel embodies the fusion of artificial
intelligence, cybersecurity domain expertise, and real-time data analysis to
combat the multifaceted challenges posed by cyber adversaries. This article
delves into the process of creating such a system and how it can interact with
other components typically found in cybersecurity organizations. Our work is a
novel approach to task-oriented dialogue systems, leveraging the power of
chaining GPT-4 models combined with prompt engineering across all sub-tasks. We
also highlight its pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity communication and
interaction, concluding that not only does this framework enhance the system's
transparency (Explainable AI) but also streamlines the decision-making process
and responding to threats (Actionable AI), therefore marking a significant
advancement in the realm of cybersecurity communication."
"Policy-mandated, rigorously administered scientific testing is needed to
provide transparency into the efficacy of artificial intelligence-based
(AI-based) cyber defense tools for consumers and to prioritize future research
and development. In this article, we propose a model that is informed by our
experience, urged forward by massive scale cyberattacks, and inspired by
parallel developments in the biomedical field and the unprecedentedly fast
development of new vaccines to combat global pathogens."
"A major cyber security incident can represent a cyber crisis for an
organisation, in particular because of the associated risk of substantial
reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has
increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is
effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the
concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to
tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the
efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach.
It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic
literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is
used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a
new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies
in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this
framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior
industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant
practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these
evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first
grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective
corporate communication after cyber security incidents."
"In the banking industry, ransomware is a well-known threat, but since the
beginning of 2022, cryptojacking, an emerging threat is posing a considerable
challenge to the banking industry. Ransomware has variants, and the attackers
keep changing the nature of these variants. This review paper studies the
complex background of these two threats and scrutinizes the actual challenges,
and problems that the banking industry and financial institutions face. These
threats, though distinct in nature, share commonalities, such as financial
motivations and sophisticated techniques. We focus on examining the newly
emerged variants of ransomware while we provide a comprehensive idea of
cryptojacking and its nature. This paper involves a detailed breakdown of the
specific threats posed by cryptojacking and ransomware. It explores the
techniques cybercriminals use, the variabilities they look for, and the
potential consequences for financial institutions and their customers. This
paper also finds out how cybercriminals change their techniques following the
security upgrades, and why financial firms including banks need to be proactive
about cyber threats. Additionally, this paper reviews the background study of
some existing papers, finds the research gaps that need to be addressed, and
provides suggestions including a conclusion and future scope on those disputes.
Lastly, we introduce a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) approach
for up-to-date cyber threat hunting processes for minimizing both cryptojacking
and ransomware attacks in the banking industry."
"Location-Based Services (LBSs) provide valuable services, with convenient
features for mobile users. However, the location and other information
disclosed through each query to the LBS erodes user privacy. This is a concern
especially because LBS providers can be honest-but-curious, collecting queries
and tracking users' whereabouts and infer sensitive user data. This motivated
both centralized and decentralized location privacy protection schemes for
LBSs: anonymizing and obfuscating LBS queries to not disclose exact
information, while still getting useful responses. Decentralized schemes
overcome disadvantages of centralized schemes, eliminating anonymizers, and
enhancing users' control over sensitive information. However, an insecure
decentralized system could create serious risks beyond private information
leakage. More so, attacking an improperly designed decentralized LBS privacy
protection scheme could be an effective and low-cost step to breach user
privacy. We address exactly this problem, by proposing security enhancements
for mobile data sharing systems. We protect user privacy while preserving
accountability of user activities, leveraging pseudonymous authentication with
mainstream cryptography. We show our scheme can be deployed with off-the-shelf
devices based on an experimental evaluation of an implementation in a static
automotive testbed."
"The wireless ad hoc networks are highly vulnerable to distributed denial of
service(DDoS) attacks because of its unique characteristics such as open
network architecture, shared wireless medium and stringent resource
constraints. These attacks throttle the tcp throughput heavily and reduce the
quality of service(QoS) to end systems gradually rather than refusing the
clients from the services completely. In this paper, we discussed the DDoS
attacks and proposed a defense scheme to improve the performance of the ad hoc
networks. Our proposed defense mechanism uses the medium access control (MAC)
layer information to detect the attackers. The status values from MAC layer
that can be used for detection are Frequency of receiving RTS/CTS packets,
Frequency of sensing a busy channel and the number of RTS/DATA retransmissions.
Once the attackers are identified, all the packets from those nodes will be
blocked. The network resources are made available to the legitimate users. We
perform the simulation with Network Simulator NS2 and we proved that our
proposed system improves the network performance."
"The multilingual nature of the Internet increases complications in the
cybersecurity community's ongoing efforts to strategically mine threat
intelligence from OSINT data on the web. OSINT sources such as social media,
blogs, and dark web vulnerability markets exist in diverse languages and hinder
security analysts, who are unable to draw conclusions from intelligence in
languages they don't understand. Although third party translation engines are
growing stronger, they are unsuited for private security environments. First,
sensitive intelligence is not a permitted input to third party engines due to
privacy and confidentiality policies. In addition, third party engines produce
generalized translations that tend to lack exclusive cybersecurity terminology.
In this paper, we address these issues and describe our system that enables
threat intelligence understanding across unfamiliar languages. We create a
neural network based system that takes in cybersecurity data in a different
language and outputs the respective English translation. The English
translation can then be understood by an analyst, and can also serve as input
to an AI based cyber-defense system that can take mitigative action. As a proof
of concept, we have created a pipeline which takes Russian threats and
generates its corresponding English, RDF, and vectorized representations. Our
network optimizes translations on specifically, cybersecurity data."
"Cybersecurity vendors consistently apply AI (Artificial Intelligence) to
their solutions and many cybersecurity domains can benefit from AI technology.
However, black-box AI techniques present some difficulties in comprehension and
adoption by its operators, given that their decisions are not always humanly
understandable (as is usually the case with deep neural networks, for example).
Since it aims to make the operation of AI algorithms more interpretable for its
users and developers, XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) can be used to
address this issue. Through a systematic literature review, this work seeks to
investigate the current research scenario on XAI applied to cybersecurity,
aiming to discover which XAI techniques have been applied in cybersecurity, and
which areas of cybersecurity have already benefited from this technology."
"Secure communication is an integral feature of many Internet services. The
widely deployed TLS protects reliable transport protocols. DTLS extends TLS
security services to protocols relying on plain UDP packet transport, such as
VoIP or IoT applications. In this paper, we construct a model to determine the
performance of generic DTLS-enabled applications. Our model considers basic
network characteristics, e.g., number of connections, and the chosen security
parameters, e.g., the encryption algorithm in use. Measurements are presented
demonstrating the applicability of our model. These experiments are performed
using a high-performance DTLS-enabled VPN gateway built on top of the
well-established libraries DPDK and OpenSSL. This VPN solution represents the
most essential parts of DTLS, creating a DTLS performance baseline. Using this
baseline the model can be extended to predict even more complex DTLS protocols
besides the measured VPN. Code and measured data used in this paper are
publicly available at https://git.io/MoonSec and https://git.io/Sdata."
"Machine Learning (ML) represents a pivotal technology for current and future
information systems, and many domains already leverage the capabilities of ML.
However, deployment of ML in cybersecurity is still at an early stage,
revealing a significant discrepancy between research and practice. Such
discrepancy has its root cause in the current state-of-the-art, which does not
allow to identify the role of ML in cybersecurity. The full potential of ML
will never be unleashed unless its pros and cons are understood by a broad
audience.
  This paper is the first attempt to provide a holistic understanding of the
role of ML in the entire cybersecurity domain -- to any potential reader with
an interest in this topic. We highlight the advantages of ML with respect to
human-driven detection methods, as well as the additional tasks that can be
addressed by ML in cybersecurity. Moreover, we elucidate various intrinsic
problems affecting real ML deployments in cybersecurity. Finally, we present
how various stakeholders can contribute to future developments of ML in
cybersecurity, which is essential for further progress in this field. Our
contributions are complemented with two real case studies describing industrial
applications of ML as defense against cyber-threats."
"As cyber threats endanger everyone, from regular users to computing
professionals, spreading cybersecurity awareness becomes increasingly critical.
Therefore, our university designed an innovative cybersecurity awareness course
that is freely available online for students, employees, and the general
public. The course offers simple, actionable steps that anyone can use to
implement defensive countermeasures. Compared to other resources, the course
not only suggests learners what to do, but explains why and how to do it. To
measure the course impact, we administered it to 138 computer science
undergraduates within a compulsory information security and cryptography
course. They completed the course as a part of their homework and filled out a
questionnaire after each lesson. Analysis of the questionnaire responses
revealed that the students valued the course highly. They reported new
learning, perspective changes, and transfer to practice. Moreover, they
suggested suitable improvements to the course. Based on the results, we have
distilled specific insights to help security educators design similar courses.
Lessons learned from this study are relevant for cybersecurity instructors,
course designers, and educational managers."
"Cybersecurity is an important topic which is often viewed as one that is
inaccessible due to steep learning curves and a perceived requirement of
needing specialist knowledge. With a constantly changing threat landscape,
practical solutions such as best-practices are employed, but the number of
critical cybersecurity-related incidents remains high. To address these
concerns, the National Cyber Security Centre published a Cybersecurity Body of
Knowledge (CyBOK) to provide a comprehensive information base used to advise
and underpin cybersecurity learning. Unfortunately, CyBOK contains over 1000
pages of in-depth material and may not be easy to navigate for novice
individuals. Furthermore, it does not allow for easy expression of various
cybersecurity scenarios that such individuals may be exposed to. As a solution
to these two issues, we propose the use of a playing cards format to provide
introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion,
using CyBOK as the foundation for the technical content. Upon evaluation in two
user studies, we found that 80% of the participants agreed the cards provided
them with introductory knowledge of cybersecurity topics, and 70% agreed the
cards provided an interface for discussing topics and enabled them to make
links between attacks, vulnerabilities and defences."
"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), ethical issues
surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous
vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the
course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting
passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted
preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over
decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system
aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful
methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially
violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information
and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties. In this paper, we
report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making
approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the notion of differential privacy to
quantify privacy and consider four granularities of privacy protection by
taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed
perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and
RLDP. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy
protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral
preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data
aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged
moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are
implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral
preference with a personalized privacy parameter. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve high
accuracy of preference aggregation while protecting individual voter's privacy."
"Virtual Reality (VR) is a multibillionaire market that keeps growing, year
after year. As VR is becoming prevalent in households and small businesses, it
is critical to address the effects that this technology might have on the
privacy and security of its users. In this paper, we explore the
state-of-the-art in VR privacy and security, we categorise potential issues and
threats, and we analyse causes and effects of the identified threats. Besides,
we focus on the research previously conducted in the field of authentication in
VR, as it stands as the most investigated area in the topic. We also provide an
overview of other interesting uses of VR in the field of cybersecurity, such as
the use of VR to teach cybersecurity or evaluate the usability of security
solutions."
"Information technology and telecommunications have rapidly permeated various
domains, resulting in a significant influx of data traversing the networks
between computers. Consequently, research of cyberattacks in computer systems
has become crucial for many organizations. Accordingly, recent cybersecurity
incidents have underscored the rapidly evolving nature of future threats and
attack methods, particularly those involving computer viruses wireless
injection. This paper aims to study and demonstrate the feasibility of remote
computer virus radiation injection. To achieve this objective, digital signal
processing (DSP) plays a vital role. By studying the principles and models of
radiation attacks and computer virus propagation, the modulation of the binary
data stream of the simulated virus into a terahertz radar carrier signal by
Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) is simulated, enabling the implementation of an attack
through the ""field to line"" coupling of electromagnetic signals. Finally, the
defense and countermeasures based on signal recognition are discussed for such
attacks. Additionally, an idea of establishing a virus library for cyberattack
signals and employing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for automated
intrusion detection is proposed as a means to achieve cybersecurity situation
awareness."
"Cyber Security scares are the main areas of demerits associated with the
advent and widespread of internet technology. While the internet has improved
life and business processes, the levels of security threats have been
increasing proportionally. As such, the web and the related cyber systems have
exposed the world to the state of continuous vigilance because of the
existential threats of attacks. Criminals are in the constant state of
attempting cybersecurity defense of various infrastructures and businesses.
Airports are some of the areas where cybersecurity means a lot of things. The
reason for the criticality of cybersecurity in airports concerns the high
integration of internet and computer systems in the operations of airports.
This paper is about airport cybersecurity and resilience controls. At the start
of the article is a comprehensive introduction that provides a preview of the
entire content. In the paper, there are discussions of airport intelligence
classification, cybersecurity malicious threats analysis, and research
methodology. A concise conclusion marks the end of the article."
"The amount of secure data being stored on mobile devices has grown immensely
in recent years. However, the security measures protecting this data have
stayed static, with few improvements being done to the vulnerabilities of
current authentication methods such as physiological biometrics or passwords.
Instead of these methods, behavioral biometrics has recently been researched as
a solution to these vulnerable authentication methods. In this study, we aim to
contribute to the research being done on behavioral biometrics by creating and
evaluating a user authentication scheme using behavioral biometrics. The
behavioral biometrics used in this study include touch dynamics and phone
movement, and we evaluate the performance of different single-modal and
multi-modal combinations of the two biometrics. Using two publicly available
datasets - BioIdent and Hand Movement Orientation and Grasp (H-MOG), this study
uses seven common machine learning algorithms to evaluate performance. The
algorithms used in the evaluation include Random Forest, Support Vector
Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multilayer
Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, with accuracy
rates reaching as high as 86%."
"COSPAS-SARSAT is an International programme for ""Search and Rescue"" (SAR)
missions based on the ""Satellite Aided Tracking"" system (SARSAT). It is
designed to provide accurate, timely, and reliable distress alert and location
data to help SAR authorities of participating countries to assist persons and
vessels in distress. Two types of satellite constellations serve COSPAS-SARSAT,
low earth orbit search and rescue (LEOSAR) and geostationary orbiting search
and rescue (GEOSAR). Despite its nearly-global deployment and critical
importance, unfortunately enough, we found that COSPAS-SARSAT protocols and
standard 406 MHz transmissions lack essential means of cybersecurity.
  In this paper, we investigate the cybersecurity aspects of COSPAS-SARSAT
space-/satellite-based systems. In particular, we practically and successfully
implement and demonstrate the first (to our knowledge) attacks on COSPAS-SARSAT
406 MHz protocols, namely replay, spoofing, and protocol fuzzing on EPIRB
protocols. We also identify a set of core research challenges preventing more
effective cybersecurity research in the field and outline the main
cybersecurity weaknesses and possible mitigations to increase the system's
cybersecurity level."
"The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has experienced
tremendous growth in recent years, bringing forth numerous benefits and
conveniences. However, this expansion has also provoked ethical concerns, such
as privacy breaches, algorithmic discrimination, security and reliability
issues, transparency, and other unintended consequences. To determine whether a
global consensus exists regarding the ethical principles that should govern AI
applications and to contribute to the formation of future regulations, this
paper conducts a meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical
guidelines for AI usage published by public bodies, academic institutions,
private companies, and civil society organizations worldwide. We identified at
least 17 resonating principles prevalent in the policies and guidelines of our
dataset, released as an open-source database and tool. We present the
limitations of performing a global scale analysis study paired with a critical
analysis of our findings, presenting areas of consensus that should be
incorporated into future regulatory efforts."
"The AI landscape demands a broad set of legal, ethical, and societal
considerations to be accounted for in order to develop ethical AI (eAI)
solutions which sustain human values and rights. Currently, a variety of
guidelines and a handful of niche tools exist to account for and tackle
individual challenges. However, it is also well established that many
organizations face practical challenges in navigating these considerations from
a risk management perspective. Therefore, new methodologies are needed to
provide a well-vetted and real-world applicable structure and path through the
checks and balances needed for ethically assessing and guiding the development
of AI. In this paper we show that a multidisciplinary research approach,
spanning cross-sectional viewpoints, is the foundation of a pragmatic
definition of ethical and societal risks faced by organizations using AI.
Equally important is the findings of cross-structural governance for
implementing eAI successfully. Based on evidence acquired from our
multidisciplinary research investigation, we propose a novel data-driven risk
assessment methodology, entitled DRESS-eAI. In addition, through the evaluation
of our methodological implementation, we demonstrate its state-of-the-art
relevance as a tool for sustaining human values in the data-driven AI era."
"This paper discusses cellular network security for unmanned aircraft systems
(UASs) and provides insights into the ongoing Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) standardization efforts with respect to authentication and
authorization, location information privacy, and command and control signaling.
We introduce the 3GPP reference architecture for network connected UAS and the
new network functions as part of the 5G core network, discuss introduce the
three security contexts, potential threats, and the 3GPP procedures. The paper
identifies research opportunities for UAS communications security and
recommends critical security features and processes to be considered for

"Modern society is getting accustomed to the Internet of Things (IoT) and
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for a variety of applications that involves
security-critical user data and information transfers. In the lower end of the
spectrum, these devices are resource-constrained with no attack protection.
They become a soft target for malicious code modification attacks that steals
and misuses device data in malicious activities. The resilient system requires
continuous detection, prevention, and/or recovery and correct code execution
(including in degraded mode). By end large, existing security primitives (e.g.,
secure-boot, Remote Attestation RA, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) and Data
Flow Attestation (DFA)) focuses on detection and prevention, leaving the proof
of code execution and recovery unanswered. To this end, the proposed work
presents lightweight RARES -- Runtime Attack Resilient Embedded System design
using verified Proof-of-Execution. It presents first custom hardware control
register (Ctrl_register) based runtime memory modification attacks
classification and detection technique. It further demonstrates the Proof Of
Concept (POC) implementation of use-case-specific attacks prevention and
onboard recovery techniques. The prototype implementation on Artix 7 Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and state-of-the-art comparison demonstrates
very low (2.3%) resource overhead and efficacy of the proposed solution."
"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected architectures that employ
analog, digital, and communication resources for their interaction with the
physical environment. CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and
critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent
targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks
targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical
nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced
leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover
vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation
under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on
CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately
represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible
attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model
formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware,
software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct
high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance
under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using
scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability
prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching
framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS
is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The
key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can
be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more
resilient and secure CPS."
"Modern computer threats are far more complicated than those seen in the past.
They are constantly evolving, altering their appearance, perpetually changing
disguise. Under such circumstances, detecting known threats, a fortiori
zero-day attacks, requires new tools, which are able to capture the essence of
their behavior, rather than some fixed signatures. In this work, we propose
novel universal anomaly detection algorithms, which are able to learn the
normal behavior of systems and alert for abnormalities, without any prior
knowledge on the system model, nor any knowledge on the characteristics of the
attack. The suggested method utilizes the Lempel-Ziv universal compression
algorithm in order to optimally give probability assignments for normal
behavior (during learning), then estimate the likelihood of new data (during
operation) and classify it accordingly. The suggested technique is generic, and
can be applied to different scenarios. Indeed, we apply it to key problems in
computer security. The first is detecting Botnets Command and Control (C&C)
channels. A Botnet is a logical network of compromised machines which are
remotely controlled by an attacker using a C&C infrastructure, in order to
perform malicious activities. We derive a detection algorithm based on timing
data, which can be collected without deep inspection, from open as well as
encrypted flows. We evaluate the algorithm on real-world network traces,
showing how a universal, low complexity C&C identification system can be built,
with high detection rates and low false-alarm probabilities. Further
applications include malicious tools detection via system calls monitoring and
data leakage identification."
"Stack Overflow (SO) is a popular platform among developers seeking advice on
various software-related topics, including privacy and security. As for many
knowledge-sharing websites, the value of SO depends largely on users'
engagement, namely their willingness to answer, comment or post technical
questions. Still, many of these questions (including cybersecurity-related
ones) remain unanswered, putting the site's relevance and reputation into
question. Hence, it is important to understand users' participation in privacy
and security discussions to promote engagement and foster the exchange of such
expertise. Objective: Based on prior findings on online social networks, this
work elaborates on the interplay between users' engagement and their privacy
practices in SO. Particularly, it analyses developers' self-disclosure
behaviour regarding profile visibility and their involvement in discussions
related to privacy and security. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach
by (i) analysing SO data from 1239 cybersecurity-tagged questions along with
7048 user profiles, and (ii) conducting an anonymous online survey (N=64).
Results: About 33% of the questions we retrieved had no answer, whereas more
than 50% had no accepted answer. We observed that ""proactive"" users tend to
disclose significantly less information in their profiles than ""reactive"" and
""unengaged"" ones. However, no correlations were found between these engagement
categories and privacy-related constructs such as Perceived Control or General
Privacy Concerns. Implications: These findings contribute to (i) a better
understanding of developers' engagement towards privacy and security topics,
and (ii) to shape strategies promoting the exchange of cybersecurity expertise
in SO."
"Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) are a necessary component for
cyber-services/infrastructures. Additionally, as cyberattacks follow a
multi-domain attack surface, a similar defensive approach should be applied,
namely, the use of an evolving multi-disciplinary solution that combines ITS,
cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the increased popularity
of AI solutions, due to Big Data use-case scenarios and decision support and
automation scenarios, new opportunities to apply Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms have emerged, namely ITS empowerment. Using ML algorithms, an ITS
can augment its intrusion tolerance capability, by learning from previous
attacks and from known vulnerabilities. As such, this work's contribution is
twofold: (1) an ITS architecture (Skynet) based on the state-of-the-art and
incorporates new components to increase its intrusion tolerance capability and
its adaptability to new adversaries; (2) an improved Risk Manager design that
leverages AI to improve ITSs by automatically assessing OS risks to intrusions,
and advise with safer configurations. One of the reasons that intrusions are
successful is due to bad configurations or slow adaptability to new threats.
This can be caused by the dependency that systems have for human intervention.
One of the characteristics in Skynet and HAL 9000 design is the removal of
human intervention. Being fully automatized lowers the chance of successful
intrusions caused by human error. Our experiments using Skynet, shows that HAL
is able to choose 15% safer configurations than the state-of-the-art risk
manager."
"As new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are integrated into
Critical National Infrastructures (CNI), new cybersecurity threats emerge that
require specific security solutions. Approaches used for analysis include the
modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes,
functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security
analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security
risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available,
the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of
interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a
system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach,
existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques)
are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and
effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that
empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based
modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based
techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy
and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive
sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool,
technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for
all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically,
deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs
between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between
specificity and generality of application in sectors."
"This paper describes the work carried out by the Inter-American Development
Bank, the IDB Lab, LACChain, Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), and Tecnologico
de Monterrey to identify and eliminate quantum threats in blockchain networks.
  The advent of quantum computing threatens internet protocols and blockchain
networks because they utilize non-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms.
When quantum computers become robust enough to run Shor's algorithm on a large
scale, the most used asymmetric algorithms, utilized for digital signatures and
message encryption, such as RSA, (EC)DSA, and (EC)DH, will be no longer secure.
Quantum computers will be able to break them within a short period of time.
Similarly, Grover's algorithm concedes a quadratic advantage for mining blocks
in certain consensus protocols such as proof of work.
  Today, there are hundreds of billions of dollars denominated in
cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain ledgers as well as the thousands of
blockchain-based applications storing value in blockchain networks.
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications require solutions that
guarantee quantum resistance in order to preserve the integrity of data and
assets in their public and immutable ledgers. We have designed and developed a
layer-two solution to secure the exchange of information between blockchain
nodes over the internet and introduced a second signature in transactions using
post-quantum keys. Our versatile solution can be applied to any blockchain
network. In our implementation, quantum entropy was provided via the IronBridge
Platform from CQC and we used LACChain Besu as the blockchain network."
"Cyber security is one of the most significant technical challenges in current
times. Detecting adversarial activities, prevention of theft of intellectual
properties and customer data is a high priority for corporations and government
agencies around the world. Cyber defenders need to analyze massive-scale,
high-resolution network flows to identify, categorize, and mitigate attacks
involving networks spanning institutional and national boundaries. Many of the
cyber attacks can be described as subgraph patterns, with prominent examples
being insider infiltrations (path queries), denial of service (parallel paths)
and malicious spreads (tree queries). This motivates us to explore subgraph
matching on streaming graphs in a continuous setting. The novelty of our work
lies in using the subgraph distributional statistics collected from the
streaming graph to determine the query processing strategy. We introduce a
""Lazy Search"" algorithm where the search strategy is decided on a
vertex-to-vertex basis depending on the likelihood of a match in the vertex
neighborhood. We also propose a metric named ""Relative Selectivity"" that is
used to select between different query processing strategies. Our experiments
performed on real online news, network traffic stream and a synthetic social
network benchmark demonstrate 10-100x speedups over selectivity agnostic
approaches."
"Blockchain technology is one of the most contemporary and disruptive
technologies in the world. It has gained considerable attention in numerous
applications such as financial services, cybersecurity applications, Internet
of Things (IoT), network data management. Now its range of applications is
beyond the financial services as the healthcare industry has also adopted
blockchain technology in its various subdomains such as Electronic Health
Records (EHR), medical supply chain management system, genomic market,
neuroscience technology, clinical research, and pharmaceutical medicine.
Blockchain is considered a secure and viable solution for storing and accessing
patients medical records and the patients can diagnosed and treated with safe
and secure data sharing. Blockchain technology will revolutionize the
healthcare systems with personalized, authentic, and secure access to the
clinical data of patients and that data can be used for further health
improvements and clinical researches. In this paper, we conduct a contemporary
research on existing applications and developments in healthcare industry with
the use of blockchain technology. We also discuss some robust applications and
various existing companies that are using blockchain solutions for securing
their data along with some current challenges and future perspectives."
"Today, the number of data-intensive and compute-intensive applications like
business and scientific workflows has dramatically increased, which made cloud
computing more popular in the matter of delivering a large amount of computing
resources on demand. On the other hand, security is a critical issue affecting
the wide adoption of cloud technologies, especially for workflows that are
mostly dealing with sensitive data and tasks. In this paper, we carry out a
review of the state-of-the-art on how security and privacy concerns in
scientific and business workflows in cloud environments are being addressed and
identify the limitations and gaps in the current body of knowledge in this
area. In this extensive literature review, we first present a classification of
the state-of-the-art security solutions organized according to the phases of
the workflow life cycle they target. Based on our findings, we provide a
detailed review and classification of the most relevant available literature
focusing on the execution, monitoring, and adaptation phases of workflows.
Finally, we present a list of open research issues related to the security of
cloud-based workflows and discuss them."
"This paper presents CyberSecEval, a comprehensive benchmark developed to help
bolster the cybersecurity of Large Language Models (LLMs) employed as coding
assistants. As what we believe to be the most extensive unified cybersecurity
safety benchmark to date, CyberSecEval provides a thorough evaluation of LLMs
in two crucial security domains: their propensity to generate insecure code and
their level of compliance when asked to assist in cyberattacks. Through a case
study involving seven models from the Llama 2, Code Llama, and OpenAI GPT large
language model families, CyberSecEval effectively pinpointed key cybersecurity
risks. More importantly, it offered practical insights for refining these
models. A significant observation from the study was the tendency of more
advanced models to suggest insecure code, highlighting the critical need for
integrating security considerations in the development of sophisticated LLMs.
CyberSecEval, with its automated test case generation and evaluation pipeline
covers a broad scope and equips LLM designers and researchers with a tool to
broadly measure and enhance the cybersecurity safety properties of LLMs,
contributing to the development of more secure AI systems."
"The rise of advanced persistent threats (APTs) has marked a significant
cybersecurity challenge, characterized by sophisticated orchestration, stealthy
execution, extended persistence, and targeting valuable assets across diverse
sectors. Provenance graph-based kernel-level auditing has emerged as a
promising approach to enhance visibility and traceability within intricate
network environments. However, it still faces challenges including
reconstructing complex lateral attack chains, detecting dynamic evasion
behaviors, and defending smart adversarial subgraphs. To bridge the research
gap, this paper proposes an efficient and robust APT defense scheme leveraging
provenance graphs, including a network-level distributed audit model for
cost-effective lateral attack reconstruction, a trust-oriented APT evasion
behavior detection strategy, and a hidden Markov model based adversarial
subgraph defense approach. Through prototype implementation and extensive
experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our system. Lastly, crucial open
research directions are outlined in this emerging field."
"Recently, advances in deep learning have been observed in various fields,
including computer vision, natural language processing, and cybersecurity.
Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its ability as a potential tool for
anomaly detection-based intrusion detection systems to build secure computer
networks. Increasingly, ML approaches are widely adopted than heuristic
approaches for cybersecurity because they learn directly from data. Data is
critical for the development of ML systems, and becomes potential targets for
attackers. Basically, data poisoning or contamination is one of the most common
techniques used to fool ML models through data. This paper evaluates the
robustness of six recent deep learning algorithms for intrusion detection on
contaminated data. Our experiments suggest that the state-of-the-art algorithms
used in this study are sensitive to data contamination and reveal the
importance of self-defense against data perturbation when developing novel
models, especially for intrusion detection systems."
"Cyber risk assessment is a fundamental activity for enhancing the protection
of an organization, identifying and evaluating the exposure to cyber threats.
Currently, this activity is carried out mainly manually and the identification
and correct quantification of risks deeply depend on the experience and
confidence of the human assessor. As a consequence, the process is not
completely objective and two parallel assessments of the same situation may
lead to different results. This paper takes a step in the direction of reducing
the degree of subjectivity by proposing a methodology to support risk assessors
with an automatic review of the produced assessment. Our methodology starts
from a controls-based assessment performed using well-known cybersecurity
frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST) and maps security controls over
infrastructural aspects that can be assessed automatically (e.g., ICT devices,
organization policies). Exploiting this mapping, the methodology suggests how
to identify controls needing revision. The approach has been validated through
a case study from the healthcare domain and a set of statistical analyses."
"We aim to demonstrate the value of mathematical models for policy debates
about technological progress in cybersecurity by considering phishing,
vulnerability discovery, and the dynamics between patching and exploitation. We
then adjust the inputs to those mathematical models to match some possible
advances in their underlying technology. We find that AI's impact on phishing
may be overestimated but could lead to more attacks going undetected. Advances
in vulnerability discovery have the potential to help attackers more than
defenders. And automation that writes exploits is more useful to attackers than
automation that writes patches, although advances that help deploy patches
faster have the potential to be more impactful than either."
"Researchers have proposed a wide range of ransomware detection and analysis
schemes. However, most of these efforts have focused on older families
targeting Windows 7/8 systems. Hence there is a critical need to develop
efficient solutions to tackle the latest threats, many of which may have
relatively fewer samples to analyze. This paper presents a machine learning(ML)
framework for early ransomware detection and attribution. The solution pursues
a data-centric approach which uses a minimalist ransomware dataset and
implements static analysis using portable executable(PE) files. Results for
several ML classifiers confirm strong performance in terms of accuracy and
zero-day threat detection."
"The goal of this paper is to propose a blockchain-based platform to enhance
transparency and traceability of cybersecurity certification information
motivated by the recently adopted EU Cybersecurity Act. The proposed platform
is generic and intended to support the trusted exchange of cybersecurity
certification information for any electronic product, service, or process.
However, for the purposes of this paper, we focus on the case study of the
cybersecurity certification of IoT devices, which are explicitly referenced in
the recently adopted Cybersecurity Act as one of the main domains where it is
highlighted the need for an increased level of trust."
"Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles,
nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intra-vehicle
networks to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern
vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything
technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles,
infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and
connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to
cyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due to the
large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have
focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on
machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, the
vulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are discussed, and a
multi-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an
anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on
vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system
can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the
CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the intra-vehicle network data and 99.88%
accuracy on the CICIDS2017 dataset illustrating the external vehicular network
data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high
F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two datasets, respectively. The
average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less
than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in
real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed IDS."
"Growing interdependencies between organizations lead them towards the
creation of inter-organizational networks where cybersecurity and sustainable
development have become one of the most important issues. The Environmental
Goods and Services Sector (EGSS) is one of the fastest developing sectors of
the economy fueled by the growing relationships between network entities based
on ICT usage. In this sector, Green Cybersecurity is an emerging issue because
it secures processes related directly and indirectly to environmental
management and protection. In the future, the multidimensional development of
the EGSS can help European Union to overcome the upcoming crises. At the same
time, computer technologies and cybersecurity can contribute to the
implementation of the concept of sustainable development. The development of
environmental technologies along with their cybersecurity is one of the aims of
the realization of sustainable production and domestic security concepts among
the EU countries. Hence, the aim of this article is a theoretical discussion
and research on the relationships between cybersecurity and sustainable
development in inter-organizational networks. Therefore, the article is an
attempt to give an answer to the question about the current state of the
implementation of cybersecurity in relation to the EGSS part of the economy in
different EU countries."
"With the powerful performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) also comes
prevalent ethical issues. Though governments and corporations have curated
multiple AI ethics guidelines to curb unethical behavior of AI, the effect has
been limited, probably due to the vagueness of the guidelines. In this paper,
we take a closer look at how AI ethics issues take place in real world, in
order to have a more in-depth and nuanced understanding of different ethical
issues as well as their social impact. With a content analysis of AI Incident
Database, which is an effort to prevent repeated real world AI failures by
cataloging incidents, we identified 13 application areas which often see
unethical use of AI, with intelligent service robots, language/vision models
and autonomous driving taking the lead. Ethical issues appear in 8 different
forms, from inappropriate use and racial discrimination, to physical safety and
unfair algorithm. With this taxonomy of AI ethics issues, we aim to provide AI
practitioners with a practical guideline when trying to deploy AI applications
ethically."
"Order-preserving encryption allows encrypting data, while still enabling
efficient range queries on the encrypted data. Moreover, it does not require
any change to the database management system, because comparison operates on
ciphertexts as on plaintexts. This makes order-preserving encryption schemes
very suitable for data outsourcing in cloud computing scenarios. However, all
order-preserving encryption schemes are necessarily symmetric limiting the use
case to one client and one server. Imagine a scenario where a Data Owner
encrypts its data before outsourcing it to the Cloud Service Provider and a
Data Analyst wants to execute private range queries on this data. This scenario
occurs in many cases of collaborative machine learning where data source and
processor are different entities. Then either the Data Owner must reveal its
encryption key or the Data Analyst must reveal the private queries. In this
paper, we overcome this limitation by allowing the equivalent of a public-key
order-preserving encryption. We present a secure multiparty protocol that
enables secure range queries for multiple users. In this scheme, the Data
Analyst cooperates with the Data Owner and the Cloud Service Provider in order
to order-preserving encrypt the private range queries without revealing any
other information to the parties. We implemented our scheme and observed that
if the database size of the Data Owner has 1 million entries it takes only
about 0.3 s on average via a loopback interface (1.3 s via a LAN) to encrypt an
input of the Data Analyst."
"As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or
inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their
threats by scaling up cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a
co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the
cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the
definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid
of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work
together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that
public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law
enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek
to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data
sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as
cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be
reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and
sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to
co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good
practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple
third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse
data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising
co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common
standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon.
We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and
sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and
standardised in order to mitigate the paradox."
"Dynamic ID-based remote user authentication schemes ensure efficient and
anonymous mutual authentication between entities. In 2013, Khan et al. proposed
an improved dynamic ID-based authentication scheme to overcome the security
flaws of Wang et al.'s authentication scheme. Recently, Sun and Cao showed that
Khan et al. does not satisfies the claim of the user's privacy and proposed an
efficient authentication scheme with user anonymity. The Sun and Cao's scheme
achieve improvement over Khan et al.'s scheme in both privacy and performance
point of view. Unfortunately, we identify that Sun and Cao's scheme does not
resist password guessing attack. Additionally, Sun and Cao's scheme does not
achieve forward secrecy."
"Cybersecurity is a crucial step in data protection to ensure user security
and personal data privacy. In this sense, many companies have started to
control and restrict access to their data using authentication systems.
However, these traditional authentication methods, are not enough for ensuring
data protection, and for this reason, behavioral biometrics have gained
importance. Despite their promising results and the wide range of applications,
biometric systems have shown to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, such as
Presentation Attacks. For this reason, in this work, we propose to study a new
approach aiming to deploy a presentation attack towards a keystroke
authentication system. Our idea is to use Conditional Generative Adversarial
Networks (cGAN) for generating synthetic keystroke data that can be used for
impersonating an authorized user. These synthetic data are generated following
two different real use cases, one in which the order of the typed words is
known (ordered dynamic) and the other in which this order is unknown
(no-ordered dynamic). Finally, both keystroke dynamics (ordered and no-ordered)
are validated using an external keystroke authentication system. Results
indicate that the cGAN can effectively generate keystroke dynamics patterns
that can be used for deceiving keystroke authentication systems."
"Internet of Things devices have seen a rapid growth and popularity in recent
years with many more ordinary devices gaining network capability and becoming
part of the ever growing IoT network. With this exponential growth and the
limitation of resources, it is becoming increasingly harder to protect against
security threats such as malware due to its evolving faster than the defence
mechanisms can handle with. The traditional security systems are not able to
detect unknown malware as they use signature-based methods. In this paper, we
aim to address this issue by introducing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis
approach using neural network and binary visualisation. The prime motivation of
the proposed approach is to faster detect and classify new malware (zero-day
malware). The experiment results show that our method can satisfy the accuracy
requirement of practical application."
"The hands-on cybersecurity training quality is crucial to mitigate cyber
threats and attacks effectively. However, practical cybersecurity training is
strongly process-oriented, making the post-training analysis very difficult.
This paper presents process-mining methods applied to the learning analytics
workflow. We introduce a unified approach to reconstruct behavioral graphs from
sparse event logs of cyber ranges. Furthermore, we discuss significant data
features that affect their practical usability for educational process mining.
Based on that, methods of dealing with the complexity of process graphs are
presented, taking advantage of the puzzle-based gamification of in-class
training sessions."
"A common problem in risk analysis is to characterize the overall security of
a system of valuable assets (e.g., government buildings or communication hubs),
and to suggest measures to mitigate any hazards or security threats. Currently,
analysts typically rely on a combination of indices, such as resilience,
robustness, redundancy, security, and vulnerability. However, these indices are
not by themselves sufficient as a guide to action; for example, while it is
possible to develop policies to decrease vulnerability, such policies may not
always be cost-effective. Motivated by this gap, we propose a new index,
defensibility. A system is considered defensible to the extent that a modest
investment can significantly reduce the damage from an attack or disruption. To
compare systems whose performance is not readily commensurable (e.g., the
electrical grid vs. the water-distribution network, both of which are critical,
but which provide distinct types of services), we defined defensibility as a
dimensionless index. After defining defensibility quantitatively, we illustrate
how the defensibility of a system depends on factors such as the defender and
attacker asset valuations, the nature of the threat (whether intelligent and
adaptive, or random), and the levels of attack and defense strengths and
provide analytical results that support the observations arising from the above
illustrations. Overall, we argue that the defensibility of a system is an
important dimension to consider when evaluating potential defensive
investments, and that it can be applied in a variety of different contexts."
"Mirai is botnet which targets out-of-date Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
The disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack last year has hit
major Internet companies, causing intermittent service for millions of Internet
users. Since the affected devices typically do not support firmware update, it
becomes challenging to expel these vulnerable devices in the wild.
  Both industry and academia have made great efforts in amending the situation.
However, none of these efforts is simple to deploy, and at the same time
effective in solving the problem. In this work, we design a collaborative
defense strategy to tackle Mirai. Our key idea is to take advantage of human
involvement in the least aggressive way. In particular, at a negotiated time
slot, a customer is required to reboot the compromised device, then a ""white""
Mirai operated by the manufacturer breaks into the clean-state IoT devices
immediately. The ""white"" Mirai expels other malicious Mirai variants, blocks
vulnerable ports, and keeps a heart-beat connection with the server operated by
the manufacturer. Once the heart-beat is lost, the server re-implants the
""white"" Mirai instantly. We have implemented a full prototype of the designed
system, and the results show that our system can evade Mirai attacks
effectively."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) relies heavily on wireless communication devices
that are able to discover and interact with other wireless devices in their
vicinity. The communication flexibility coupled with software vulnerabilities
in devices, due to low cost and short time-to-market, exposes them to a high
risk of malware infiltration. Malware may infect a large number of network
devices using device-to-device (D2D) communication resulting in the formation
of a botnet, i.e., a network of infected devices controlled by a common
malware. A botmaster may exploit it to launch a network-wide attack sabotaging
infrastructure and facilities, or for malicious purposes such as collecting
ransom. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to study the D2D
propagation of malware in wireless IoT networks. Leveraging tools from dynamic
population processes and point process theory, we capture malware infiltration
and coordination process over a network topology. The analysis of mean-field
equilibrium in the population is used to construct and solve an optimization
problem for the network defender to prevent botnet formation by patching
devices while causing minimum overhead to network operation. The developed
analytical model serves as a basis for assisting the planning, design, and
defense of such networks from a defender's standpoint."
"Breached data refers to the unauthorized access, theft, or exposure of
confidential or sensitive information. Breaches typically occur when malicious
actors or unauthorized users breach secure systems or networks, resulting in
compromised personally identifiable information (PII), protected or personal
health information (PHI), payment card industry (PCI) information, or other
sensitive data. Data breaches are often the result of malicious activities such
as hacking, phishing, insider threats, malware, or physical theft. The misuse
of breached data can lead to identity theft, fraud, spamming, or blackmailing.
Organizations that experience data breaches may face legal and financial
consequences, reputational damage, and harm to their customers or users.
Breached records are commonly sold on the dark web or made available on various
public forums. To counteract these malicious activities, it is possible to
collect breached databases and mitigate potential harm. These databases can be
quite large, reaching sizes of up to 150 GB or more. Typically, breached data
is stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Value) format due to its simplicity and
lightweight nature, which reduces storage requirements. Analyzing and
traversing large breached databases necessitates substantial computational
power. However, this research explores techniques to optimize database
traversal speed without the need to rent expensive cloud machines or virtual
private servers (VPS). This optimization will enable individual security
researchers to analyze and process large databases on their personal computer
systems while significantly reducing costs."
"The effectiveness and efficiency of 5G software stack vulnerability and
unintended behavior detection are essential for 5G assurance, especially for
its applications in critical infrastructures. Scalability and automation are
the main challenges in testing approaches and cybersecurity research. In this
paper, we propose an innovative approach for automatically detecting
vulnerabilities, unintended emergent behaviors, and performance degradation in
5G stacks via run-time profiling documents corresponding to fuzz testing in
code repositories. Piloting on srsRAN, we map the run-time profiling via
Logging Information (LogInfo) generated by fuzzing test to a high dimensional
metric space first and then construct feature spaces based on their timestamp
information. Lastly, we further leverage machine learning-based classification
algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random
Forest to categorize the impacts on performance and security attributes. The
performance of the proposed approach has high accuracy, ranging from $ 93.4 \%
$ to $ 95.9 \% $, in detecting the fuzzing impacts. In addition, the proof of
concept could identify and prioritize real-time vulnerabilities on 5G
infrastructures and critical applications in various verticals."
"Risk is the best known and perhaps the best studied example within a much
broader class of cyber security metrics. However, risk is not the only possible
cyber security metric. Other metrics such as resilience can exist and could be
potentially very valuable to defenders of ICS systems. Often, metrics are
defined as measurable properties of a system that quantify the degree to which
objectives of the system are achieved. Metrics can provide cyber defenders of
an ICS with critical insights regarding the system. Metrics are generally
acquired by analyzing relevant attributes of that system. In terms of cyber
security metrics, ICSs tend to have unique features: in many cases, these
systems are older technologies that were designed for functionality rather than
security. They are also extremely diverse systems that have different
requirements and objectives. Therefore, metrics for ICSs must be tailored to a
diverse group of systems with many features and perform many different
functions. In this chapter, we first outline the general theory of performance
metrics, and highlight examples from the cyber security domain and ICS in
particular. We then focus on a particular example of a class of metrics that is
different from the one we have considered in earlier chapters. Instead of risk,
here we consider metrics of resilience. Resilience is defined by the National
Academy of Sciences (2012) as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb,
recover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events.
This chapter presents two approaches for the generation of metrics based on the
concept of resilience using a matrix-based approach and a network-based
approach. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of different
methods is presented along with a process and tips intended to aid in devising
effective metrics."
"Quantum key distribution (QKD) was conceived by Charles Bennett and Gilles
Brassard in December of 1984. In the ensuing 39 years QKD systems have been
deployed around the world to provide secure encryption for terrestrial as well
as satellite communication. In 2016 the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) began a program to standardize a series of quantum resistant
algorithms to replace our current encryption standards thereby protecting
against future quantum computers breaking public key cryptography. This program
is known as post quantum cryptography or PQC. One of the tenets of
cybersecurity is to use an approach that simultaneously provides multiple
protections known as defense-in-depth. This approach seeks to avoid single
points of failure. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of a
hybrid QKD / PQC defense-in-depth strategy. A focus of the paper will be to
examine the sufficiency of initial QKD hardware authentication (entity source
authentication) which is necessary to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks."
"We report on the status of our Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) project
that is creating and validating a concept inventory for cybersecurity, which
assesses the quality of instruction of any first course in cybersecurity. In
fall 2014, we carried out a Delphi process that identified core concepts of
cybersecurity. In spring 2016, we interviewed twenty-six students to uncover
their understandings and misconceptions about these concepts. In fall 2016, we
generated our first assessment tool--a draft Cybersecurity Concept Inventory
(CCI), comprising approximately thirty multiple-choice questions. Each question
targets a concept; incorrect answers are based on observed misconceptions from
the interviews. This year we are validating the draft CCI using cognitive
interviews, expert reviews, and psychometric testing. In this paper, we
highlight our progress to date in developing the CCI.
  The CATS project provides infrastructure for a rigorous evidence-based
improvement of cybersecurity education. The CCI permits comparisons of
different instructional methods by assessing how well students learned the core
concepts of the field (especially adversarial thinking), where instructional
methods refer to how material is taught (e.g., lab-based, case-studies,
collaborative, competitions, gaming). Specifically, the CCI is a tool that will
enable researchers to scientifically quantify and measure the effect of their
approaches to, and interventions in, cybersecurity education."
"The benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely acknowledged, but there
are concerns about the extent of these benefits and AV risks and unintended
consequences. In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of
the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that
can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by
governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far,
governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to
promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus
on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The
US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to
privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws
to address liability issues, other countries mostly acknowledge these issues,
but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and
cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV
specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less
attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks,
although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might
be negatively affected."
"Aminopropyl modified mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticles, MCM-41 type, have been
synthesized by the co-condensation method from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)
and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). By means of modifying TEOS/APTES ratio
we have carried out an in-depth characterization of the nanoparticles as a
function of APTES content. Surface charge and nanoparticles morphology were
strongly influenced by the amount of APTES and particles changed from hexagonal
to bean-like morphology insofar APTES increased. Besides, the porous structure
was also affected, showing a contraction of the lattice parameter and pore
size, while increasing the wall thickness. These results bring about new
insights about the nanoparticles formation during the co-condensation process.
The model proposed herein considers that different interactions stablished
between TEOS and APTES with the structure directing agent have consequences on
pore size, wall thickness and particle morphology. Finally, APTES is an
excellent linker to covalently attach active targeting agents such as folate
groups. We have hypothesized that APTES could also play a role in the
biological behavior of the nanoparticles. So, the internalization efficiency of
the nanoparticles has been tested with cancerous LNCaP and non-cancerous
preosteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. The results indicate a cooperative effect
between aminopropylsilane presence and folic acid, only for the cancerous LNCaP
cell line."
"Security issues, threats, and attacks in relation with the IoT have been
identified as promising and challenging area of research. Eventually, the need
for a forensics methodology for investigating IoT-related crime is therefore
essential. However, the IoT poses many challenges for forensics investigators.
These include the wide range and variety of information, the unclear lines of
differentiation between networks, for example private networks increasingly
fading into public networks. Further, integration of a large number of objects
in IoT forensic interest, along with the relevance of identified and collected
devices makes forensic of IoT devices more complicated. The scope of this paper
is to present a framework for IoT forensic. We aimed at the study and
development of the link to support digital investigations of IoT devices and
tackle emerging challenges in digital forensics. We emphasize on various steps
for digital forensic with respect to IoT devices."
"Internet technology is so pervasive today, for example, from online social
networking to online banking, it has made people's lives more comfortable. Due
the growth of Internet technology, security threats to systems and networks are
relentlessly inventive. One such a serious threat is ""phishing"", in which,
attackers attempt to steal the user's credentials using fake emails or websites
or both. It is true that both industry and academia are working hard to develop
solutions to combat against phishing threats. It is therefore very important
that organisations to pay attention to end-user awareness in phishing threat
prevention. Therefore, the aim of our paper is twofold. First, we will discuss
the history of phishing attacks and the attackers' motivation in details. Then,
we will provide taxonomy of various types of phishing attacks. Second, we will
provide taxonomy of various solutions proposed in literature to protect users
from phishing based on the attacks identified in our taxonomy. Moreover, we
have also discussed impact of phishing attacks in Internet of Things (IoTs). We
conclude our paper discussing various issues and challenges that still exist in
the literature, which are important to fight against with phishing threats."
"In recent years, cyber-physical system (CPS) security as applied to robotic
systems has become a popular research area. Mainly because robotics systems
have traditionally emphasized the completion of a specific objective and lack
security oriented design. Our previous work, HoneyBot \cite{celine}, presented
the concept and prototype of the first software hybrid interaction honeypot
specifically designed for networked robotic systems. The intuition behind
HoneyBot was that it would be a remotely accessible robotic system that could
simulate unsafe actions and physically perform safe actions to fool attackers.
Unassuming attackers would think they were connected to an ordinary robotic
system, believing their exploits were being successfully executed. All the
while, the HoneyBot is logging all communications and exploits sent to be used
for attacker attribution and threat model creation. In this paper, we present
findings from the result of a user study performed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the HoneyBot framework and architecture as it applies to real
robotic systems. The user study consisted of 40 participants, was conducted
over the course of several weeks, and drew from a wide range of participants
aged between 18-60 with varying level of technical expertise. From the study we
found that research subjects could not tell the difference between the
simulated sensor values and the real sensor values coming from the HoneyBot,
meaning the HoneyBot convincingly spoofed communications."
"The rapid evolution of the Smart-everything movement and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) advancements have given rise to sophisticated cyber threats
that traditional methods cannot counteract. Cyber threats are extremely
critical in financial technology (FinTech) as a data-centric sector expected to
provide 24/7 services. This paper introduces a novel and refined taxonomy of
security threats in FinTech and conducts a comprehensive systematic review of
defensive strategies. Through PRISMA methodology applied to 74 selected studies
and topic modeling, we identified 11 central cyber threats, with 43 papers
detailing them, and pinpointed 9 corresponding defense strategies, as covered
in 31 papers. This in-depth analysis offers invaluable insights for
stakeholders ranging from banks and enterprises to global governmental bodies,
highlighting both the current challenges in FinTech and effective
countermeasures, as well as directions for future research."
"The battle to mitigate Android malware has become more critical with the
emergence of new strains incorporating increasingly sophisticated evasion
techniques, in turn necessitating more advanced detection capabilities. Hence,
in this paper we propose and evaluate a machine learning based approach based
on eigenspace analysis for Android malware detection using features derived
from static analysis characterization of Android applications. Empirical
evaluation with a dataset of real malware and benign samples show that
detection rate of over 96% with a very low false positive rate is achievable
using the proposed method."
"As networks expand in size and complexity, they pose greater administrative
and management challenges. Software Defined Networks (SDN) offer a promising
approach to meeting some of these challenges. In this paper, we propose a
policy driven security architecture for securing end to end services across
multiple SDN domains. We develop a language based approach to design security
policies that are relevant for securing SDN services and communications. We
describe the policy language and its use in specifying security policies to
control the flow of information in a multi-domain SDN. We demonstrate the
specification of fine grained security policies based on a variety of
attributes such as parameters associated with users and devices/switches,
context information such as location and routing information, and services
accessed in SDN as well as security attributes associated with the switches and
Controllers in different domains. An important feature of our architecture is
its ability to specify path and flow based security policies, which are
significant for securing end to end services in SDNs. We describe the design
and the implementation of our proposed policy based security architecture and
demonstrate its use in scenarios involving both intra and inter-domain
communications with multiple SDN Controllers. We analyse the performance
characteristics of our architecture as well as discuss how our architecture is
able to counteract various security attacks. The dynamic security policy based
approach and the distribution of corresponding security capabilities
intelligently as a service layer that enable flow based security enforcement
and protection of multitude of network devices against attacks are important
contributions of this paper."
"The cyberthreat landscape is continuously evolving. Hence, continuous
monitoring and sharing of threat intelligence have become a priority for
organizations. Threat reports, published by cybersecurity vendors, contain
detailed descriptions of attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)
written in an unstructured text format. Extracting TTP from these reports aids
cybersecurity practitioners and researchers learn and adapt to evolving attacks
and in planning threat mitigation. Researchers have proposed TTP extraction
methods in the literature, however, not all of these proposed methods are
compared to one another or to a baseline. \textit{The goal of this study is to
aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners choose attack technique
extraction methods for monitoring and sharing threat intelligence by comparing
the underlying methods from the TTP extraction studies in the literature.} In
this work, we identify ten existing TTP extraction studies from the literature
and implement five methods from the ten studies. We find two methods, based on
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF) and Latent Semantic Indexing
(LSI), outperform the other three methods with a F1 score of 84\% and 83\%,
respectively. We observe the performance of all methods in F1 score drops in
the case of increasing the class labels exponentially. We also implement and
evaluate an oversampling strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues.
Furthermore, oversampling improves the classification performance of TTP
extraction. We provide recommendations from our findings for future
cybersecurity researchers, such as the construction of a benchmark dataset from
a large corpus; and the selection of textual features of TTP. Our work, along
with the dataset and implementation source code, can work as a baseline for
cybersecurity researchers to test and compare the performance of future TTP
extraction methods."
"We studied variability in General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) awareness
in relation to digital experience in the 28 European countries of EU27-UK,
through secondary analysis of the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey conducted in March
2019 (N = 27,524). Education, occupation, and age were the strongest
sociodemographic predictors of GDPR awareness, with little influence of gender,
subjective economic well-being, or locality size. Digital experience was
significantly and positively correlated with GDPR awareness in a linear model,
but this relationship proved to be more complex when we examined it through a
typological analysis. Using an exploratory k-means cluster analysis we
identified four clusters of digital citizenship, across both dimensions of
digital experience and GDPR awareness: the off-line citizens (22%), the social
netizens (32%), the web citizens (17%), and the data citizens (29%). The
off-line citizens ranked lowest in internet use and GDPR awareness; the web
citizens ranked at about average values, while the data citizens ranked highest
in both digital experience and GDPR knowledge and use. The fourth identified
cluster, the social netizens, had a discordant profile, with remarkably high
social network use, below average online shopping experiences, and low GDPR
awareness. Digitalization in human capital and general internet use is a strong
country-level correlate of the national frequency of the data citizen type. Our
results confirm previous studies of the low privacy awareness and skills
associated with intense social media consumption, but we found that young
generations are evenly divided between the rather carefree social netizens and
the strongly invested data citizens."
"Mobile applications are used to handle different types of data. Commonly,
there is a set of personal identifiable information present in the data stored,
shared and used by these applications. From that, attackers can try to exploit
the mobile application in order to obtain or to cause private data leakage.
Therefore, performing security assessments is an important practice to find
vulnerabilities in the applications and systems before the application is
deployed, or even during their use. Regarding security assessments, Penetration
Test (Pentest) is one of the security test types that can be used to detect
vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. Additionally, Pentest can be
performed using different methodologies and best practices, through several
frameworks to: organize the test execution, execute tools, provide estimations,
provide reports and document a Pentest. One such framework is Tramonto, which
aims to assist a cybersecurity expert during the Pentest execution by providing
organization, standardization and flexibility to the whole Pentest process.
This paper presents a Pentest case study applied to a Brazilian university
Mobile App using the Tramonto framework. The main goal of this case study is to
present how Tramonto can be applied during a Pentest execution, assisting
cybersecurity experts in the tasks included in the Pentest process. Our results
show details on how to perform a Pentest using Tramonto and the found
vulnerabilities in the Mobile App. Besides that, there is a discussion about
the main contributions obtained from our results, and we were able to verify
that Tramonto managed, organized and optimized the whole Pentest process."
"The knowledge on attacks contained in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports
is very important to effectively identify and quickly respond to cyber threats.
However, this knowledge is often embedded in large amounts of text, and
therefore difficult to use effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel approach and tool called EXTRACTOR that allows precise automatic
extraction of concise attack behaviors from CTI reports. EXTRACTOR makes no
strong assumptions about the text and is capable of extracting attack behaviors
as provenance graphs from unstructured text. We evaluate EXTRACTOR using
real-world incident reports from various sources as well as reports of DARPA
adversarial engagements that involve several attack campaigns on various OS
platforms of Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Our evaluation results show that
EXTRACTOR can extract concise provenance graphs from CTI reports and show that
these graphs can successfully be used by cyber-analytics tools in
threat-hunting."
"Cyber Resilience is an important property of complex systems and is important
consideration in developing specific IoT applications. This work aims at
introducing a novel approach to assess IoT resilience adopting the risk
perception in network based epidemic spreading approach. In particular IoT has
been considered a network of devices where the probability of infection and
interactions (communication), needs to be balanced in order to reduce the
malware outbreack while maintaining the network functionalities at an
acceptable level. The mathematical model and the simulation results reveal the
benefit of a shift from a risk-based to a resilience based approach to threat
management in IoT."
"Over the past three years, especially following WannaCry malware, ransomware
has become one of the biggest concerns for private businesses, state, and local
government agencies. According to Homeland Security statistics, 1.5 million
ransomware attacks have occurred per year since 2016. Cybercriminals often use
creative methods to inject their malware into the target machines and use
sophisticated cryptographic techniques to hold hostage victims' files and
programs unless a certain amount of equivalent Bitcoin is paid. The return to
the cybercriminals is so high (estimated \$1 billion in 2019) without any cost
because of the advanced anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, especially
Bitcoin \cite{Paquet-Clouston2019}. Given this context, this study first
discusses the current state of ransomware, detection, and prevention systems.
Second, we propose a global ransomware center to better manage our concerted
efforts against cybercriminals. The policy implications of the proposed study
are discussed in the conclusion section."
"Blockchain technology is a crypto-based secure ledger for data storage and
transfer through decentralized, trustless peer-to-peer systems. Despite its
advantages, previous studies have shown that the technology is not completely
secure against cyber attacks. Thus, it is crucial to perform domain specific
risk analysis to measure how viable the attacks are on the system, their impact
and consequently the risk exposure. Specifically, in this paper, we carry out
an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to an operational
multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We
conduct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. The
analysis identified five attack goals and five types of attackers that violate
the security of the blockchain system. In the case study of the public
permissioned BSMD, we highlight the highest risk factors according to their
impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. Four
attack goals represent a risk in terms of economic losses and one attack goal
contains many threats that represent a risk that is either unacceptable or
undesirable."
"The rise of large language models (LLMs) has had a significant impact on
various domains, including natural language processing and artificial
intelligence. While LLMs such as ChatGPT have been extensively researched for
tasks such as code generation and text synthesis, their application in
detecting malicious web content, particularly phishing sites, has been largely
unexplored. To combat the rising tide of automated cyber attacks facilitated by
LLMs, it is imperative to automate the detection of malicious web content,
which requires approaches that leverage the power of LLMs to analyze and
classify phishing sites. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes
ChatGPT to detect phishing sites. Our approach involves leveraging a web
crawler to gather information from websites and generate prompts based on this
collected data. This approach enables us to detect various phishing sites
without the need for fine-tuning machine learning models and identify social
engineering techniques from the context of entire websites and URLs. To
evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using
a dataset. The experimental results using GPT-4 demonstrated promising
performance, with a precision of 98.3% and a recall of 98.4%. Comparative
analysis between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 revealed an enhancement in the latter's
capability to reduce false negatives. These findings not only highlight the
potential of LLMs in efficiently identifying phishing sites but also have
significant implications for enhancing cybersecurity measures and protecting
users from the dangers of online fraudulent activities."
"Cybersecurity professionals need hands-on training to prepare for managing
the current advanced cyber threats. To practice cybersecurity skills, training
participants use numerous software tools in computer-supported interactive
learning environments to perform offensive or defensive actions. The
interaction involves typing commands, communicating over the network, and
engaging with the training environment. The training artifacts (data resulting
from this interaction) can be highly beneficial in educational research. For
example, in cybersecurity education, they provide insights into the trainees'
learning processes and support effective learning interventions. However, this
research area is not yet well-understood. Therefore, this paper surveys
publications that enhance cybersecurity education by leveraging
trainee-generated data from interactive learning environments. We identified
and examined 3021 papers, ultimately selecting 35 articles for a detailed
review. First, we investigated which data are employed in which areas of
cybersecurity training, how, and why. Second, we examined the applications and
impact of research in this area, and third, we explored the community of
researchers. Our contribution is a systematic literature review of relevant
papers and their categorization according to the collected data, analysis
methods, and application contexts. These results provide researchers,
developers, and educators with an original perspective on this emerging topic.
To motivate further research, we identify trends and gaps, propose ideas for
future work, and present practical recommendations. Overall, this paper
provides in-depth insight into the recently growing research on collecting and
analyzing data from hands-on training in security contexts."
"Information sharing in organization has been considered as an important
approach in increasing organizational efficiency, performance and decision
making. With the present and advances in information and communication
technology, sharing information and exchanging of data across organizations has
become more feasible in organization. However, information sharing has been a
complex task over the years and identifying factors that influence information
sharing across organization has becomes crucial and critical. Researchers have
taken several methods and approaches to resolve problems in information sharing
at all levels without a lasting solution, as sharing is best understood as a
practice that reflects behavior, social, economic, legal and technological
influences. Due to the limitation of the conventional ISM3 standards to address
culture, social, legislation and human behavior, the findings in this paper
suggest that, a centralized information structure without human practice,
distribution of information and coordination is not effective. This paper
reviews the previous information sharing research, outlines the factors
affecting information sharing and the different practices needed to improve the
management of information security by recommending several combinations of
information security and coordination mechanism for reducing uncertainty during
sharing of information .This thesis proposes information security management
protocol (ISMP) as an enhancement towards ISM3 to resolve the above problems.
This protocol provides a means for practitioners to identify key factors
involved in successful information sharing....."
"Cybersecurity is now more important than ever, and so is education in this
field. However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of
concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the
state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine
papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a
total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus
on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and
teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching
context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors. We
discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most
prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security),
and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well.
The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on
tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of
collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less
than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators,
and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide
orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further
research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone
new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and
synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available
dataset."
"Existing education systems are facing a threat of question paper leaking
(QPL) in the exam which jeopardizes the quality of education. Therefore, it is
high time to think about a more secure and flexible question sharing system
which can prevent QPL issue in the future education system. Blockchain enables
a way of creating and storing transactions, contracts or anything that requires
protection against tampering, accessing etc. This paper presents a new scheme
for smart education, by utilizing the concept of blockchain, for question
sharing. A two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question paper (QSP)
is proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using timestamp and in the
second phase, previous encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp,
salt hash and hashes from previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in the
blockchain along with a smart contract which helps the user to unlock the
selected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam
which picks a QSP randomly. Moreover, a timestamp based lock is imposed on the
scheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Finally,
security is analyzed by proving different propositions and the superiority of
the proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study
based on the different features."
"In the field of document forensics, ink analysis plays a crucial role in
determining the authenticity of legal and historic documents and detecting
forgery. Visual examination alone is insufficient for distinguishing visually
similar inks, necessitating the use of advanced scientific techniques. This
paper proposes an ink analysis technique based on hyperspectral imaging, which
enables the examination of documents in hundreds of narrowly spaced spectral
bands, revealing hidden details. The main objective of this study is to
identify the number of distinct inks used in a document. Three clustering
algorithms, namely k-means, Agglomerative, and c-means, are employed to
estimate the number of inks present. The methodology involves data extraction,
ink pixel segmentation, and ink number determination. The results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed technique in identifying ink clusters and
distinguishing between different inks. The analysis of a hyperspectral cube
dataset reveals variations in spectral reflectance across different bands and
distinct spectral responses among the 12 lines, indicating the presence of
multiple inks. The clustering algorithms successfully identify ink clusters,
with k-means clustering showing superior classification performance. These
findings contribute to the development of reliable methodologies for ink
analysis using hyperspectral imaging, enhancing the"
"We reflect on our ongoing journey in the educational Cybersecurity Assessment
Tools (CATS) Project to create two concept inventories for cybersecurity. We
identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain
the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions,
highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better.
  The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept
inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure
the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity.
The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently
completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum
Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate
major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same
five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background.
  Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts,
uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems,
developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials,
performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops,
building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration,
adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding.
  Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity
presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle,
where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to
construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We
hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more
effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM."
"Crypto-ransomware remains a significant threat to governments and companies
alike, with high-profile cyber security incidents regularly making headlines.
Many different detection systems have been proposed as solutions to the
ever-changing dynamic landscape of ransomware detection. In the majority of
cases, these described systems propose a method based on the result of a single
test performed on either the executable code, the process under investigation,
its behaviour, or its output. In a small subset of ransomware detection
systems, the concept of a scorecard is employed where multiple tests are
performed on various aspects of a process under investigation and their results
are then analysed using machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to
propose a new majority voting approach to ransomware detection by developing a
method that uses a cumulative score derived from discrete tests based on
calculations using algorithmic rather than heuristic techniques. The paper
describes 23 candidate tests, as well as 9 Windows API tests which are
validated to determine both their accuracy and viability for use within a
ransomware detection system. Using a cumulative score calculation approach to
ransomware detection has several benefits, such as the immunity to the
occasional inaccuracy of individual tests when making its final classification.
The system can also leverage multiple tests that can be both comprehensive and
complimentary in an attempt to achieve a broader, deeper, and more robust
analysis of the program under investigation. Additionally, the use of multiple
collaborative tests also significantly hinders ransomware from masking or
modifying its behaviour in an attempt to bypass detection."
"With an exponential increase in number of users switching to mobile banking,
various countries are adopting biometric solutions as security measures. The
main reason for biometric technologies becoming more common in the everyday
lives of consumers is because of the facility to easily capture biometric data
in real time, using their mobile phones. Biometric technologies are providing
the potential security framework to make banking more convenient and secure
than it has ever been. At the same time, the exponential growth of enrollment
in the biometric system produces massive amount of high dimensionality data
that leads to degradation in the performance of the mobile banking systems.
Therefore, in order to overcome the performance issues arising due to this data
deluge, this paper aims to propose a distributed mobile biometric system based
on a high performance cluster Cloud. High availability, better time efficiency
and scalability are some of the added advantages of using the proposed system.
In this paper a Cloud based mobile biometric authentication framework
(BAMCloud) is proposed that uses dynamic signatures and performs
authentication. It includes the steps involving data capture using any handheld
mobile device, then storage, preprocessing and training the system in a
distributed manner over Cloud. For this purpose we have implemented it using
MapReduce on Hadoop platform and for training Levenberg-Marquardt
backpropagation neural network has been used. Moreover, the methodology adopted
is very novel as it achieves a speedup of 8.5x and a performance of 96.23%.
Furthermore, the cost benefit analysis of the implemented system shows that the
cost of implementation and execution of the system is lesser than the existing
ones. The experiments demonstrate that the better performance is achieved by
proposed framework as compared to the other methods used in the recent
literature."
"In this work, we present and analyze reported failures of artificially
intelligent systems and extrapolate our analysis to future AIs. We suggest that
both the frequency and the seriousness of future AI failures will steadily
increase. AI Safety can be improved based on ideas developed by cybersecurity
experts. For narrow AIs safety failures are at the same, moderate, level of
criticality as in cybersecurity, however for general AI, failures have a
fundamentally different impact. A single failure of a superintelligent system
may cause a catastrophic event without a chance for recovery. The goal of
cybersecurity is to reduce the number of successful attacks on the system; the
goal of AI Safety is to make sure zero attacks succeed in bypassing the safety
mechanisms. Unfortunately, such a level of performance is unachievable. Every
security system will eventually fail; there is no such thing as a 100% secure
system."
"Attacks on software systems occur world-wide on a daily basis targeting
individuals, corporations, and governments alike. The systems that facilitate
maritime shipping are at risk of serious disruptions, and these disruptions can
stem from vulnerabilities in the software and processes used in these systems.
These vulnerabilities leave such systems open to cyber-attack. Assessments of
the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but
have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying
vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are
important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security
issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals. In
response, we formed a key collaboration between an experienced academic
cybersecurity team and a well-known commercial software provider that manages
maritime shipping. We performed an analysis of the information flow involved in
the maritime shipping process, and then executed an in-depth vulnerability
assessment of the software that manages freight systems. In this paper, we show
the flow of information involved in the freight shipping process and explain
how we performed the in-depth assessment, summarizing our findings. Like every
large software system, maritime shipping systems have vulnerabilities."
"The lack of security in information systems has caused numerous financial and
moral losses to several organizations. The organizations have a series of
information security measures recommended by literature and international
standards. However, the implementation of policies, actions, and adjustment to
such standards is not simple and must be addressed by specific needs identified
by the Information Security Governance in each organization. There are many
challenges in effectively establishing, maintaining, and measuring information
security in a way that adds value. Those challenges demonstrate a need for
further investigations which address the problem. This paper presents a
strategy to measure the maturity in information security aiming, also, to
assist in the application and prioritization of information security actions in
the corporate environment. For this, a survey was used as the main
methodological instrument, reaching 157 distinct companies. As a result, it was
possible to classify the ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 controls in four stages
according to the importance given by the companies. The COBIT maturity levels
and a risk analysis matrix were also used. Finally, the adaptable strategy was
successfully tested in a company"
"The Smart Grid (SG) is a cornerstone of modern society, providing the energy
required to sustain billions of lives and thousands of industries.
Unfortunately, as one of the most critical infrastructures of our World, the SG
is an attractive target for attackers. The problem is aggravated by the
increasing adoption of digitalisation, which further increases the SG's
exposure to cyberthreats. Successful exploitation of such exposure leads to
entire countries being paralysed, which is an unacceptable -- but ultimately
inescapable -- risk.
  This paper aims to mitigate this risk by elucidating the perspective of real
practitioners on the cybersecurity of the SG. We interviewed 18 entities,
operating in diverse countries in Europe and covering all domains of the SG --
from energy generation, to its delivery. Our analysis highlights a stark
contrast between (a)research and practice, but also between (b) public and
private entities. For instance: some threats appear to be much less dangerous
than what is claimed in related papers; some technological paradigms have
dubious utility for practitioners, but are actively promoted by literature;
finally, practitioners may either under- or over-estimate their own
cybersecurity capabilities. We derive four takeaways that enable future
endeavours to improve the overall cybersecurity in the SG. We conjecture that
most of the problems are due to an improper communication between researchers,
practitioners and regulatory bodies -- which, despite sharing a common goal,
tend to neglect the viewpoint of the other `spheres'."
"Network slicing in 3GPP 5G system architecture has introduced significant
improvements in the flexibility and efficiency of mobile communication.
However, this new functionality poses challenges in maintaining the privacy of
mobile users, especially in multi-hop environments. In this paper, we propose a
secure and privacy-preserving network slicing protocol (SPNS) that combines 5G
network slicing and onion routing to address these challenges and provide
secure and efficient communication. Our approach enables mobile users to select
network slices while incorporating measures to prevent curious RAN nodes or
external attackers from accessing full slice information. Additionally, we
ensure that the 5G core network can authenticate all RANs, while avoiding
reliance on a single RAN for service provision. Besides, SPNS implements
end-to-end encryption for data transmission within the network slices,
providing an extra layer of privacy and security. Finally, we conducted
extensive experiments to evaluate the time cost of establishing network slice
links under varying conditions. SPNS provides a promising solution for
enhancing the privacy and security of communication in 5G networks."
"Cybersecurity training should be adaptable to evolving the cyber threat
landscape, cost effective and integrated well with other enterprise management
components. Unfortunately, very few cybersecurity training platforms can
satisfy such requirements. This paper proposes a new and novel model for
conducting cybersecurity training with three main objectives: (i) training
should be initiated by emerging relevant threats and delivered first to the
most vulnerable members (ii) the process has to be agile (iii) training results
must be able to provide actionable intelligence. For the first time, this paper
establishes a type system (ontology and associated relationships) that links
the domain of cybersecurity awareness training with that of cyber threat
intelligence. Powered by IBM Watson Knowledge Studio platform, the proposed
method was found to be practical and scalable. Main contributions such as
exports of the type system, the manually annotated corpus of 100 threat reports
and 127 cybersecurity assessment results, the dictionaries for pre-annotation,
etc were made publicly available."
